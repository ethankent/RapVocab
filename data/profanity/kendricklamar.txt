couldnt have smarts and a smirk could get you hurt wound diversed from a scar fourhundred years of nothing fourhundred years of suffering fourhundred years of tears and tribulation miseducation see what we facing is now coming back to the roots remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot call us and figured that wed never lived in pursuit of happiness we captured these feelings in things that we do thought its abstinence in slavery but we made it come to a modern perspective my shoe selection got ta be louie her handbag got ta

clever i just need to free my thoughts and lord knows that i know better but i aint perfect i aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses you should either hear me now or go deaf or end up dead die trying and know death might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect i mean that from the bottom of my heart you see my art is all i have and victory tastes sweet even when the enemy can throw salt still knock em out the
park like a tow car let bygones be bygones but where im from we buy guns and more guns to give to the young im living the life of a trapped inside the system all you envision is trap my uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight he told me rap about life not rap thats why im shaking my head when you rap dissing my stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching i start evaluating then my final intuition is that you wishing a come up would just come up we used to beefing over
turf beefing over a verse dying a double entendre and this is compton lions in the land of the triumph wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance put burners in the hands of the black man one hood with twenty fofos like a cloned kobe bryant you probably heard i wan na be heard and wonder who i am you probably even listen to faith and think i know zion but really im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth because it seem like its always clashing with science i got a big fear of flying my future

time we get into it im the one thats feeling stupid you dont need me you gon leave me thats your favorite threat why you never know how it feel to be lonely why i feel im the last option after your homies why you always got ta know that i will never let you go even though you get violent and put your hands on me sometimes she says she loves me she says she loves me so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone but shes beautiful like sometimes when i have things
on my mind shes the perfect person to listen and she only gives advice she says when i give her a cue she says she loves me like when i wake up in the morning shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me she says she needs me she says she loves me or like when im stepping out of the shower shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off she says she says she loves me so instead of admitting that she has made another

of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught three in one room first time i was tossed and im exhausted but that sorry for your loss my sister died in
vain but what point are you trying to gain if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight ill probably live longer than you and never fade away ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate and

moons i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im sure not why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the scheme of wondering when im a rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that
put me in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursing the life of generations after her soul exactly would have happened if i hadnt continued rappin or steady being distracted by money drugs and four fives i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong fighting for your rights even when youre wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about

and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wan na go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang colour than mines doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if
i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another and thats all i wrote i was gon na call another but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground represent the ground is gon na open
up and swallow the evil thats how i see it my word is bond i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gon na open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gon na be so fat they gon na be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetising the poor gon na be so poor and hungry you know what im saying its gon na be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich aight so let
me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years
you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for us and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true you know what im saying
and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree
you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back aight well how long you think it take before be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wan na lay it all down in this country a black man only have like years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wan na lift weights while you still wan na shoot back cause once you turn its like they take the heart and soul out of a man
out of a black man in this country and you dont wan na fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth year old thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today i think that is tireda grabbin out the stores and next time its a riot theres gon na be bloodshed for
real i dont think america can know that i think american think we was just playing and its gon na be some more playing but it aint gon na be no playing its gon na be murder you know what im saying its gon na be like nat turner up in this you know what im saying its gon na happen thats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type
of energy imma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because the spirits we aint really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it
noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts hes trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to
this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the eternal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same whats your perspective on that pac pac pac come here girl oh you want me to touch you right there oh like a little lamb play in your hair oh you want it oh you want it right now like that i got you baby all on you baby push it back on daddy
