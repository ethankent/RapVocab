and realistically who is god in eternal blackness in the midst of the darkest night proteins and minerals exist within specks of light solids liquids and gases and sparks of light within infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights no beginning or ending the seven dimensions enough space for more than a million words and inventions to travel through time within enough room to be the womb of the most highs great mind which he will soon make shine with intelligent elements in sight that he will gather in the realms of relativity electricity struck matter energies explode he
below to keep releasin atoms by the millions til the numbers increasin til it was burnin he kept returnin itself to the source the hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force he gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws all caused by his mental intercourse who is god he began to explain his craft the master in the attic he dealt with measurements his language was mathematics his theoretical wisdom of the numerical system the complete number nine which means born or existed he gave birth to all planets inorganic and organic so you wouldnt
take it for granted they rotated they own distance around the sun and fully submit to the existance of one and each one was promised everlasting perfection if each one keeps spinnin in the same direction to the east and each speak the motion of peace and harmony and each show devotion to teach the universe is to come the whole world must go according know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin so stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round from unconciousness to conciousness by knowledging his wisdom his response
is this a understanding which is the best part he picked the third planet where new forms of life would start he pursued show and prove every move in order back to the source he let off his resources in the water climb his climax where the climate is at high degrees see he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas and the plan is to lay in the clays to form land and expand usin the same clays to born man in his own image our origin begins in the east culture rise to breed with the powers
