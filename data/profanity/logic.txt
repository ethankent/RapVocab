was lord forgive him now my nephew aint got a father thatll keep him safe all i can hope is he a good boy for his mommas sake cause she never did recover from his fathers fate and if he grew into a man that made the same mistake well to be honest i dont know how much more she could take so to every baby momma that could truly relate it is you unto this song that i should dedicate yeah uh uh yeah i got it now what is it pay the world a visit let them know

headphones up thats all you sayin but im sprayin and i cant get enough raw rugged and rough my alter ego mrtough ill call your bluff face to face never snuff i murder you with predicate poetic balletic no mercy cause if i grip the mic they might curse me da vinci flow before i grip the mic im in control before i manifested tendons i was rhyming as a embryo living in vertigo half of these dont know its logic i said its logic welcome to some thats considered legendary im here to put the rap game in the
cemetery they told me it couldnt happen aint no way in hell you gon make millions off of rapping but im just so determined catch me on the stage spitting verses like a sermon you know i had to make them realize lights camera action mawfucka check the real in my eyes now they all looking so surprised the dawn of a new era like the sun had arise through these lyrics i am immortalized strictly spiting the truth but the rest is telling more lies this the type of most people fantasize but this the i used to analyze
they told me i was too underground so i took the mic out my basement and found another sound i want it i need it im coming for the crown cant nobody stop me im rocky lets go another round im kinda on my rockafella meets nelson mandela raining money no umbrella flow most of these people they will never know watchu have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow see im in love with this shorty right but first i got ta get this story right cause in this business love will never last sold out shows hoes
and a whole lotta damn what a concoction but these hoes aint an option cause a woman what im looking for a girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane or maybe im just going insane on the road to success so im living in the fast lane my mentor once told me that fire can not be denied im years old and ive sacrificed the last four years of my life to create music just for you my social life stayin in the studio practicing grinding just to give you the soundtracks for your life so im gon
na continue to wake up every day and make good music and get that recognition and i deserve it i think i deserve it its becoming something thats impossible to ignore and i deserve it i think i deserve it yeah now let me switch it up with some you aint ever heard aint drunk but the flows slow everybody just relax and listen to my words so many times have i designed a similar rhyme that came to mind inevitable to find the way im feelin now im feeling like im ready to blow been waiting patiently but it

off the hook so none of yall can debate it solid making music cause i never really related to this that they spit claiming that they made it similar to a eight guard cause i cant fade it use your logic you could never evade it im kinda like the young sinatra mixed with sammy davis jr already know where they are doing the best to ever to do it rhyming to improve and take rap and move it in another direction and spread like infection better yet lice cause im always on they mind im a breed of different
kind yes im ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme you can catch me in the booth from dusk till the sun up the super mario flow i always get the up yeah we gun up laser got ta how we run up not really but it sounded tight shut up around and steal your just to get the nut up really what up with everybody looking for a deal you can call me indyana jones and im headed for the throne going on the mj beat leave me alon e this is music who are you

the path and are pioneers let me kick rhymes let me do it slow got ta get it every time you aint know see im half white and half negro so i guess thats why i got a big ego i got double the talent so i guess im too nice tryna eat like two dykes cause im famished better yet im in the depths of hungary like budapest and even when im fed im a keep going til the death call me the caller bomber cause im blowing minds like osama thats word to obama so much action within
my words there aint no time for drama bringing wisdom like dalai lama you aint heard my name is castro hotter than taking shots of tabasco im the never constipated i got mad flow have you wondering why the did he go do that for i dont know even my homies say im an my style is so defined cause im the definition of truth you want proof well then you better listen im never dissin thats a waste of time why waste an amazing rhyme on them when i can take it and make it mine ill make it
fine homie i dont need no ones help i stay on dimes so you can call me roosevelt yeah my flow is presidential i rip it acapella i dont need the instrumental so try to sleep on me i leave you like tom in seattle my wordplay is too vicious homie so you dont wan na scrabble you dont wan na battle my will leave you without a paddle now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle my wifey livin like oprah matter of fact princess diana cause my first name is sir and i dont live like

i got this i taste the blood no one can stop this second i drop this die hard fans is finna cop this while the rest of the world follows through fiber optics i took my time see i studied the game learned how to rhyme i was around drugs and gats but never delved in crime had other things in mind so i began to grind first tape was a success locally i got press but i knew this one right here would run the world a mess but i digress a year ago i was a youngun in
his room staring out the window lookin at the moon knowing its coming soon but today i bought this rocket ship and sonic boom cause i am no longer a seed homie its time to bloom we should shine a light on a light on and the book of rightons right on it was right on they lost and i found it we leave em astounded asking me how you so fly yet you still so grounded i replied i died inside resurrected a beast leave em deceased musics in my genes like a crease got it capiche hungry as
hell trying to eat now success is the only thing that cant complete us grinding to free us the beat knocking like a fetus close your eyes open up your ears so you can see this now ive accepted im not from the hood cause selling crack and busting gats dont make my raps good see this is me logic repping md to the fullest push us to the limit but never pull us now i cant wait til i see my name in neon that fly i be on flowing for eons every day i take chances celine dion

pencil biting off of my rhymes that aint even an insult cause you couldnt produce and in the end that your fault it takes millions years for a diamond to shine i did it in see im ahead of my time cause when i flow the crowd never roll cause i rock on the road to success haters in my blind spot cause i got no time to wake up you cracker motha see all i ever wanted was a window to sit close to and you dont understand but in the end you aint supposed to im talking first
class feet under my living life on the dash constant pursuit of cash now im living a life that you and yours could only dream about and just a couple ago this i used to scheme about rehearsing for hours in front of my mirror until my voice was hoarse but my vision was clearer see this that new school style but the flow remind you of them old days fast forward to the present rappers have no class like snow days good god let me bring it back to hiphops first renaissance koolaid and sega genesis hey yo hey

the weather i think about you and imagine a house and some kids i wonder if you found another and its all his see baby girl i know you love me even through the lies cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes sometimes i see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl i know you hear it my heart is calling for you tonight and even though the time is wrong i know the love is right thats why
theres so much emotion when i recite anything about this angel that lost its sight baby you were my everything but you playing games around got me feeling like blowing my brains but you aint worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action i used to count the days with you but now i just subtract them let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight
let me go let me go tonight you were my best friend but then you out me i never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me so in the end it only shows that you dont give a about me i know you hearing the emotion thats deep in this letter but i dont give a about what you think i write it so that the people can feel better that ive gone through what ive gone through memories of a perfect love thats broken and haunt you and if you think i write
this song to taunt you i dont want you i want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday and have an endless love with an angel from up above but now it would seem my baby girl has fallen and another path within my life is calling cause i put everything below you everything below you even my music and when you left me i didnt lose it i channeled deep within emotions and used it my heart you broke it and bruised it so now i address this microphone and just ooze
it i am not a poet i am just a designer of words architecting sentences the way i form and merge paragraphs together that force mcs to submerge with an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell feast on my memories please come and taste this papa was a black man mama was a racist growing up she called me kids called me cracker while the whites got whiter and the blacks got blacker i was hurting doing everything i can conceived as a white boy with the soul of a black man god damn looking up to
malcolm x studying his speeches underlining text how can i be white devil if my parents had cus im black and im white and im proud of every word that i recite i know my roots i know my past i know the issue of my race aint gon na last yo we all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood and when we die the same dish gets dug i still have a dream it is a dream teached within the american dream that one day this nation will rise up live out the true meaning of
being free behold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equally im on the come up anything that yall do im one up yall grind till like in the morning i grind till the sun up homie thats dedication this world is what im facing i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me im trying to write my wrongs but its funny these same wrongs helped me write this song momma im sorry that i left at i apologize a trillion times everything aint what it seem when you try and

dont know he got lyrics he got flow but it takes so much mo so much love so much pain with such little time to grow yeah we love it when he smile but hate it when he frown remember when that girl turned his world upside down but it made his music better brought emotion made it clever now we growing everyday but he hungry try to eat brain like an ekg the way that he study the beat now we know that he gon make it and he wont accept defeat now i aint tryin to be mean
now i aint tryin to be mean but everything aint what it seem so many times did i design a rhyme to blow your mind cause i know that i wasnt destined to live a life of crime i remember christmass with no presents i use to fear my future now i dread my adolescence living a life of logic but it aint what its cut out to be cause if i couldnt rap yall wouldnt give a about me hip hop is politics filled with nothing but strife and stress time is money and its hard to invest step

takes a team at the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety so truly he is me and you cant face me now ive had a lot of doubt i thought i had to throw that out cause i find that they listen when i rhyme not when i shout and right now is rocky with me and my girl see music is my moon but this shawty is my world think about you all the time turn that into a rhyme cause sometimes you can ignore
me but the beat listens just fine tell me do you even know if you truly want to grow hate letters when im writing love jones all i know cause everything aint what it seems living a life you only dream about flow angelic but now its time to bring the demon out can you feel me i said its hard being a saint inside a sinners body you know its hard living as logic after living as bobby this is the life i depicted as a child i picked it feeling conflicted to music i am addicted not one
