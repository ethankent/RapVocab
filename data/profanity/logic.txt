analyze they told me i was too underground so i took the mic out my basement and found another sound i want it i need it im coming for the crown cant nobody stop me im rocky lets go another round im kinda on my rockafella meets nelson mandela raining money no umbrella flow most of these people they will never know watchu have to sacrifice as a person to truly grow see im in love with this shorty right but first i got ta get this story right cause in this business love will never last sold out shows
hoes and a whole lotta ass damn what a concoction but these hoes aint an option cause a woman what im looking for a girl with wisdom that give me brain so insane or maybe im just going insane on the road to success so im living in the fast lane my mentor once told me that fire can not be denied im years old and ive sacrificed the last four years of my life to create music just for you my social life stayin in the studio practicing grinding just to give you the soundtracks for your life so
im gon na continue to wake up every day and make good music and get that recognition and i deserve it i think i deserve it its becoming something thats impossible to ignore and i deserve it i think i deserve it yeah now let me switch it up with some you aint ever heard aint drunk but the flows slow everybody just relax and listen to my words so many times have i designed a similar rhyme that came to mind inevitable to find the way im feelin now im feeling like im ready to blow been waiting patiently

now im off the hook so none of yall can debate it solid making music cause i never really related to this that they spit claiming that they made it similar to a eight guard cause i cant fade it use your logic you could never evade it im kinda like the young sinatra mixed with sammy davis jr already know where they are doing the best to ever to do it rhyming to improve and take rap and move it in another direction and spread like infection better yet lice cause im always on they mind im a breed
of different kind yes im ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme you can catch me in the booth from dusk till the sun up the super mario flow i always get the up yeah we gun up laser got ta how we run up not really but it sounded tight shut up around and steal your just to get the nut up really what up with everybody looking for a deal you can call me indyana jones and im headed for the throne going on the mj beat leave me alon e this is music who

people make the path and are pioneers let me kick rhymes let me do it slow got ta get it every time you aint know see im half white and half negro so i guess thats why i got a big ego i got double the talent so i guess im too nice tryna eat like two dykes cause im famished better yet im in the depths of hungary like budapest and even when im fed im a keep going til the death call me the caller bomber cause im blowing minds like osama thats word to obama so much
action within my words there aint no time for drama bringing wisdom like dalai lama you aint heard my name is castro hotter than taking shots of tabasco im the never constipated i got mad flow have you wondering why the did he go do that for i dont know even my homies say im an my style is so defined cause im the definition of truth you want proof well then you better listen im never dissin thats a waste of time why waste an amazing rhyme on them when i can take it and make it mine ill
make it fine homie i dont need no ones help i stay on dimes so you can call me roosevelt yeah my flow is presidential i rip it acapella i dont need the instrumental so try to sleep on me i leave you like tom in seattle my wordplay is too vicious homie so you dont wan na scrabble you dont wan na battle my will leave you without a paddle now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle my wifey livin like oprah matter of fact princess diana cause my first name is sir and i dont

though now im on another level but yall arent near it though my soul bleedin on the track so spiritual its a blessing cause now rappin is my profession yo set to detonate im just waitin for my time to blow white boy at first glance but when i ryhme they know race dont mean a thing the second that i flow its been a year and everything i said would happened has while everybody that i know is out havin a blast i was right here in the studio bustin my ass its been a year im but i
feel and now i got this i taste the blood no one can stop this second i drop this die hard fans is finna cop this while the rest of the world follows through fiber optics i took my time see i studied the game learned how to rhyme i was around drugs and gats but never delved in crime had other things in mind so i began to grind first tape was a success locally i got press but i knew this one right here would run the world a mess but i digress a year ago i was
a youngun in his room staring out the window lookin at the moon knowing its coming soon but today i bought this rocket ship and sonic boom cause i am no longer a seed homie its time to bloom we should shine a light on a light on and the book of rightons right on it was right on they lost and i found it we leave em astounded asking me how you so fly yet you still so grounded i replied i died inside resurrected a beast leave em deceased musics in my genes like a crease got it
capiche hungry as hell trying to eat now success is the only thing that cant complete us grinding to free us the beat knocking like a fetus close your eyes open up your ears so you can see this now ive accepted im not from the hood cause selling crack and busting gats dont make my raps good see this is me logic repping md to the fullest push us to the limit but never pull us now i cant wait til i see my name in neon that fly i be on flowing for eons every day i take
chances celine dion said every day i take chances celine dion lets get it im a diamond in a rough but i shine like discos surrounded by greasy people like i doused them in crisco i havent shined yet so tell me where does the rest go up a million percent until they finally hear this though bumping up in they city like oh my god this go my business getting better every year like fiscal a pad and a pen a mic my only utensil im original see but they trace like stencil i stain in the game but
you fade like pencil biting off of my rhymes that aint even an insult cause you couldnt produce and in the end that your fault it takes millions years for a diamond to shine i did it in see im ahead of my time cause when i flow the crowd never roll cause i rock on the road to success haters in my blind spot cause i got no time to wake up you ass cracker ass motha see all i ever wanted was a window to sit close to and you dont understand but in the end you aint

knew it all but couldnt predict the weather i think about you and imagine a house and some kids i wonder if you found another and its all his see baby girl i know you love me even through the lies cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes sometimes i see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl i know you hear it my heart is calling for you tonight and even though the time is wrong i know
the love is right thats why theres so much emotion when i recite anything about this angel that lost its sight baby you were my everything but you playing games around got me feeling like blowing my brains but you aint worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action i used to count the days with you but now i just subtract them let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight let
me go let me go tonight let me go let me go tonight you were my best friend but then you out me i never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me so in the end it only shows that you dont give a about me i know you hearing the emotion thats deep in this letter but i dont give a about what you think i write it so that the people can feel better that ive gone through what ive gone through memories of a perfect love thats broken and haunt you
and if you think i write this song to taunt you i dont want you i want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday and have an endless love with an angel from up above but now it would seem my baby girl has fallen and another path within my life is calling cause i put everything below you everything below you even my music and when you left me i didnt lose it i channeled deep within emotions and used it my heart you broke it and bruised it so now i
address this microphone and just ooze it i am not a poet i am just a designer of words architecting sentences the way i form and merge paragraphs together that force mcs to submerge with an urge to break free of this biracial jail cell feast on my memories please come and taste this papa was a black man mama was a racist growing up she called me kids called me cracker while the whites got whiter and the blacks got blacker i was hurting doing everything i can conceived as a white boy with the soul of a black
man god damn looking up to malcolm x studying his speeches underlining text how can i be white devil if my parents had cus im black and im white and im proud of every word that i recite i know my roots i know my past i know the issue of my race aint gon na last yo we all breathe the same air and bleed the same blood and when we die the same dish gets dug i still have a dream it is a dream teached within the american dream that one day this nation will rise up
live out the true meaning of being free behold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equally im on the come up anything that yall do im one up yall grind till like in the morning i grind till the sun up homie thats dedication this world is what im facing i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace me im trying to write my wrongs but its funny these same wrongs helped me write this song momma im sorry that i left at i apologize a trillion times everything aint what
it seem when you try and follow your dreams first you saw the bigger picture now you see behind the scenes you though everything was sweet now you see that is mean got a taste now you a fiend been into it since you been a teen yeah he nice so all his friends say he gon blow like hiroshim eyes on the prize like the baddest you ever seen at home late night chillin envisioning himself on the cover of vibe magazine but everything aint what it seems though it seem like he gon blow will he make it
maybe so too be honest i dont know he got lyrics he got flow but it takes so much mo so much love so much pain with such little time to grow yeah we love it when he smile but hate it when he frown remember when that girl turned his world upside down but it made his music better brought emotion made it clever now we growing everyday but he hungry try to eat brain like an ekg the way that he study the beat now we know that he gon make it and he wont accept defeat now
i aint tryin to be mean now i aint tryin to be mean but everything aint what it seem so many times did i design a rhyme to blow your mind cause i know that i wasnt destined to live a life of crime i remember christmass with no presents i use to fear my future now i dread my adolescence living a life of logic but it aint what its cut out to be cause if i couldnt rap yall wouldnt give a about me hip hop is politics filled with nothing but strife and stress time is money
and its hard to invest step on the stage i get the honeys so wet rockin thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but moet thinking im so set but really i aint done yet this game is war and in my mind im like a vietnam vet now im on the come up anything that yall do ill one up yall grind till in the morning i grind till the sun up homie thats dedication this world is what im facing i only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em for the that hated i made
it slowly elevated escalated onto another level ha my flow is crack the game is whitney yeah fame is bobby on their first date it aint hit me yet visualizing driving down the horizon while you despising the fact that im rising so much hate within this world this is so traumatizing steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready aim steady lyricism sharp as machete i got it already see i was born to sell records you was destined to sell tunes all up your headphones killing booths like cellphones i got it cause everything aint what is
seems it aint just him it takes a team at the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety so truly he is me and you cant face me now ive had a lot of doubt i thought i had to throw that out cause i find that they listen when i rhyme not when i shout and right now is rocky with me and my girl see music is my moon but this shawty is my world think about you all the time turn that into a
rhyme cause sometimes you can ignore me but the beat listens just fine tell me do you even know if you truly want to grow hate letters when im writing love jones all i know cause everything aint what it seems living a life you only dream about flow angelic but now its time to bring the demon out can you feel me i said its hard being a saint inside a sinners body you know its hard living as logic after living as bobby this is the life i depicted as a child i picked it feeling conflicted to
music i am addicted not one of yall can predict it so many bars im feeling convicted now writing like a felony im selling homie who you telling while yall do everything by the book that im rebelling im on another level a level you aint seen a level that is truly only deemed for a king the second you listen its my mission to murder any rendition busting with precision if you in my vision im never missing logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener can you feel me i know what its like to be

hilarious all these stupid groupie want to marry us and just a year ago i had to pay to perform and now venues across the country dropping stacks to go on ive been working for years and sometimes i get heated but those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it i do it for the fans they know what the message is rattpack is world wide dont believe it check the messages and now im back but im a switch the style up we moving at high speed these are dialed up you know i formulate my
words like a dissertation so let a brother proceed like litigation i know you feel this deep inside of you no penetration we got something for everybody but in my duration you got ta crawl before you walk i ball but you blog share knowledge like its stocks since they the apart back in the days and the millimeter strays that grazed my old apartment to wherever i dreamed thats where my heart went now as a baby my mama was on the bottle couldnt wait till i was of the age to hit the loto or the throtto and
im gone like the world all i had was music and my girl till that fell apart and this life averelled never the less i atest and am i blessed hell yes occasional stress but i only bite what i can digest back in the day it was jeans and white tees now that i got all the sponsors i can keep up with the companies now im not bragging about material possessions im trying to teach you a lesson about business and progression and what happens when you perfect the image in your profession aint no second guessing you
know its all about perception i used to talk about the things i wasnt really doing but i had to visualize it before i started pursuing it yeah huh and now a doing it but business aside its been a beautiful ride cause i do it for the fans and brush the haters aside i cant wait for the day when i look through the eyes of my bride cause every lion needs its queen and make its children is pride but these haters really dont know what the message is dont know what the message is once again dont

about how much im black again you dont like to blame god for my packaging bringing up my race dont call me a white rapper then damn they judging me by my skin tone instead of my talent man these been wrong but its all good i just thought id address it and spell it out for people so they can finally assess it this is dedicated to anyone with a dream and a realization of what following it means breaking the cycle and not following your genes that perfect moment when your logic intervenes and let you know that
everything aint always what it seems but if you really looking i promise youll find your dreams this is everything i ever wanted half of yall wont get it the other will probably laugh and wonder how i did it i just spit it from my mind one word at the time take everything im going through and put it in a rhyme id be lying if i said i didnt have a lot of weight upon my shoulders but this is my therapy as i flow this spilling out my heart i just hope somebody notice ive been real

this is a letter to the fans that understand what ive done and even though ive got ta leave man dont none of yall grieve cause even in the mainstream that lyricism i breathe some of yall love my raw records some of yall dont some of yall will love my radio some of yall wont just like my race my music has always been yin and yang something for everybody no not just one lane and on the real ill never forget the day i got my deal full creative control and the money was unreal started from the
bottom and got here cause of my skill and i never set a goal that i didnt plan to fulfill youre not any less of a man if you dont pull the trigger youre not necessarily a man if you do this concludes midnight marauder program press any key to return to the main menu yeah this is my vision written without second thought or revision the type of that affect you like an oncoming collision that just make you freeze drop to your knees and beg em please lord forgive me for gripping a semi now when searching for
god all i ever do is stare up while satan sending me women wearing nothing but they hair up got the condom on the dresser i cant wait to undress her would you think lesser of me if i did it cause i get lonely im human and boy its been a minute fresh out the states surrounded by women that wan na hit it but should i take the just cause i could get it or do i want something thats more committed god damn its hard to admit it as you focus on the little things the bigger
ones will get you so i minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture i get richer while you hate so keep it up and watch a young brother elevate im black and white but racism i still can not evade i never understood the concept even to this day you know were all the same in the eyes of a blade because when men share blood its to the same shade thats why im just a man homie flesh and blood im just a man but i dont think they understand homie i aint perfect im just a man
yall think im more than just a man i contemplate on the daily if ill survive and strive to be the greatest lyricist dead or alive i got ta prevail thats my word like excel went from a small town in west deer park to xxl now we shopping at louis v back in the day it was ross they calling me the savior hope they dont give me the cross now thats the realest you ever heard never in the streets but i was closer than the curb do you feel me whole world wan na kill me signed
a deal but im still me in five years will i still be ever since i was a youngin this is all ive ever wanted always kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted i was in the studio while they was gettin blunted always have my doubts but deep down i knew id run it sportin armani like menage a trois thats double breasted a lot of time ive invested and never once have i rested feeling nervous like when you getting tested the game is over saturated completely infested the greatest story ever told realest song ever written
to hell with a plan b i aint kiddin im just trying to get this money im just trying to get paid thats the type of mentality put careers in the grave how much you made whats it worth if your memory fades now i aint perfect on occasion im strayed its been forever since i prayed and i guess today is the day so i step in the booth and treat that like a confession thinking back as i reminisce wondering does god even exist a man of faith but mentally i feel at risk what you want from
me where am i supposed to go seems like you never talk tell me how im supposed to know im just a man i aint perfect is this life even worth it its time to dig up the past so it lets unearth it like my childhood living free like a child should remember the time i opened the bedroom door crack and saw my daddy smoking more crack no food in my house we just couldnt afford that momma drinking sleeping until five but she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived feeling alone at like eleven segregated
from the other kids like it was ive loved ive hated ive cried ive died inside ive resurrected but dont neglect that ive modified im stronger faster better than ever before and everything ive been through can honestly assure im no less no more i wonder what it feel like to do that in real life and now i know i got it thats the reason no id has signed me on the dotted but its still visionary till the death of me yeah im tryna make it but i got ta find the recipe greatest of all time i
want the world addressing me at the hotel these beautiful girls undressing me im tryna stay focused i guess thats the lord testing me i knew as a child that this was my destiny they do it for the limelight but i make sure my rhymes right waiting till the times right smiling at my moms like smiling at my mom smiling at my mamma mo t what we sipping now we was never tripping now we on private jets in other words that means that we tripping now cause they was over there i was over here they was

this planet right that we call paradise because we hope it can sustain life why because well eventually run out of resources exactly i mean what if we got there and its exactly as the data predicted beautiful lush then we destroy it just like we did earth theres only million human beings left in the universe i mean its weird to think about the fact that in the last footprint was left on earth before ascending to babel man whats your point the point is ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this damn near
all of them return without any luck some of them didnt return at all i guess my fear isnt that we wont find paradise its that well create purgatory now this that spottieottiedopaliscious hella vicious i wonder where is this hold up get the out my business show enough we roll up then load up just a bastard born in a wedlock close to the earth like a dreadlock got my sites on deadlock visions of my enemy in a headlock feel like im livin in bedrock surrounded by rubble just a youngin in trouble took a shot and then

whats crazy is original music hasnt been created since earth i know man lucidity what back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness we took for granted was obvious water food supply its insane to think everyday life for everyone in babel is the quest for paradise i guess thats what im looking for what being able to make music not just that if the laws are abolished following the migration were free dude were not slaves thomas we arent you cant do anything outside the cause not really thats why we watch the
same movies and listen to the same music i mean dont get me wrong the catalogue is incredible but we need i dont know something more yeah somethin more get em living life on the east coast way back in the day trying to beat most anybody that wan na do what i do well let me keep it one hunna with you it ain t about that ain t about hip hop ain t about rap think a minute hold up use your cap chicago know i mma snap got ta say no basic rapping so they wonder who

important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time you ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid it is absolutely stupid better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way and after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you
will find others will but it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track see what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing so it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there therefore it s so important to consider this

to say you see in gaza theyre fighting for land you see they need this land cause its a part of their plan understand the jews needed a place after hitler so they got about three quarters of palestinian land palestinians then had to make refuges in places like lebanon in places where none of them had ever gone thousands were massacred for not leaving see id do the same kill me ill die believing i understand the mind of a man who commits suicide but dont agree with any innocent that has to die and whats gon na happen
after this will they stop with the gaza strip i dont think so i sat with a jew to learn he told me thats its not meant to go to israel until the prophet returns i said is this true he told me go and read the torah cause if its true then theyre following another order how can a nation that knows what its like to be slaughtered go and do the same to someone else im just a spectator looking in but i can tell you how i think things shouldve been a couple reasons why the worlds
where it is today please listen to my words what i have to say i dont know everything and never will i claim to know what our purpose is and what we really need to grow but i do know were dying for a common cause a global word that is well known war ive been to africa and seen a grown man on the floor disabled to the point i couldnt look anymore a real beggar in a real state of poverty but he prays everyday so he knows that theres got ta be another life where he can
live as a strong man and the ownership of africa doesnt end up in the wrong hands western palms buying and destroying people just to trade arms could someone tell me why africa is just surviving the whole land was a resource plus they got diamonds used to be able to run your hand through the sand and get a handful of diamonds do you understand how precious is the land if its like that you see its wrong to say it was taken by the white man it was taken by the power hungry and the people that never
saw the beauty of africa fam they only saw the money to them it was the land of opportunity its terrorism when its done by either you or me treat these words like my eulogy and remember that i died being exactly what i choose to be inshaallah we all can see that god is the goodness in you and me no religion has ownership see the quran and the bible and the torah were all wrote with ink see i think the masses are miseducated see most of the politicians were born racist see its obvious that somehow were
all related millions of years back before we separated i heard tony benn say it in a speech see how can you murder another brother because hes weak your ancestors could have been cousins so take a seat and try and reason with your brother fam before you beef im just a spectator looking in from my view im not different or special im just like you bleed blood and shed tears when my hearts hurting i get energy from everything in life im learning how to say my thoughts release my stress through my words make you visualise everything
youve ever heard picture ancient egyptians meditating to the elements telepathically debating until the pirates came in the form of tradesmen promised them a paradise in exchange for a heaven temptation and misinterpretation so they jeopardise the whole of the nation you see a paradise is where we might choose to go but a heaven is the place where the angels go so they can reason with the prophets not bathe in gold and its not late for no one to save your soul im a citizen of truth love and loyalty every person on the planet is royalty these
are my thoughts how i look at things fam im just a spectator looking in uh uh uh yeah vs up what it is visionary were takin over the whole biz all over your city like we in the blow biz never go hollywood even though we in show biz baby girl i just wan na give it to you like you never had it when it comes to music im an addict and killa aint anotha illa for relida thats where the dilla rest in peace the best were beats and i thought id bring da heat like five
