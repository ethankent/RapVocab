look at it is like this even me man coming up in that game right i came up in that game man and i was blind to a lot of things and even though i came to jail for some i believe that the karma had a lot to do with that see thats what happened with fat boy when he disrespected me in the game but i was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon have karma so
karma swings for me both ways what you put out you get back you put out good you gon get good it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between but i dun learned cause when i was on the street i used to go hard in the paint about different what i learned over the years though is man sometimes you aint got ta be the judge the jury or the situation cause karma gon na handle it s business cause it s fair late night down sunset liking the scene on a
