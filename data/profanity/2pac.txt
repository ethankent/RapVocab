and even more alarming is the fact that we are not fighting back brothers sisters when i say it is not the we have grown to fear it is not the we say as if it has no meaning but to me it means never ignorant getting goals accomplished what are we going to do walk blind into a line or fight fight and die if we must die like this is for the masses the lower classes the ones you left out jobs were giving better living but we were kept out made to feel inferior but were superior
break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us honour a man that refuses to respect us emancipation proclamation please lincoln just said that to save the nation these are lies that we all accepted say no to drugs but the governments kept it running through our community killing the unity the war on drugs is a war on you and me and yet they say this is the home of the free but if you ask me its all about hypocrisy the constitution yo it dont apply to me
and lady liberty stupid lied to me this made me strong and no ones gon na like what im pumpin but its wrong to keep someone from learning something so get up its time to start nation building im fed up we got ta start teach the children that they can be all that they want to be theres much more to life than just poverty this is definitely uh words of wisdom america america amerikkka i charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault for suppressing and punishing my people i charge you with robbery for robbing
me of my history i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me trapped in the projects and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes prosecutor do you have any more evidence words of wisdom based upon the strength of a nation conquer the enemy armed with education protect yourself reach for what you want to do know thyself teach by what weve been through armed with the knowledge of the place weve been no one will ever oppress this race again no malcolm x in my history
text whys that cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks why is martin luther king in my book each week he told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek i dont get it so many questions went through my mind i get sweated they act like asking questions is a crime but forget it cause one day im gon na prove them wrong not every brother had his mother on the welfare line the american dream though it seems like its attainable theyre pulling your sleeve dont believe cause it will strangle ya pulling the life
of your brain i cant explain beg as you can obtain from which you came swear that your mother is living in equality forgetting your brother thats living in poverty thought they had us beaten when they took out king but the battle aint over till the black man sings words of wisdom the battle aint over till the black man sings words of wisdom nightmare thats what i am americas nightmare i am what you made me the hate and the evil that you gave me i shine as a reminder of what youve done to my people for

pregnant im surprised i aint retarded at night i cant sleep count sheep as they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep starin at the wall heard a scream wake up in the mornin see the blood in the hall from the murder scene dont cry just ask why and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto lullabye on the corner where the slang they crack and the undercovers jack those that dont watch they back fiveoh i daydream about the dope world take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
my mausberg goes boom whats another plug snatchin drugs pumpin slugs in these other thugs give it up dont run out of breath every step could be death til you blast and be the last left then ill be ghost dont cry just ask why and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto lullabye dont cry just ask why and try not to die as i take you through a ghetto lullabye a sevendeuce full of goes by thought i was trippin the second time they rolled by recognized the plates the faces looked familiar everybody
swear they know the thats gon na kill ya dont murder me murder me killa a in his sleep let me die as i rest in peace deep back to these in the sevendeuce a mac out the window bout to let it loose what could i do run for cover and return fire die die hope yo ass fry dont ask why but i let off everything i have an empty clip hit the ground as a dash on my ass was the cops now barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down booyaow is the sound bullet
whizzed by still runnin like a got nine lives dont know why but im runnin to my block took a shot tired of runnin from the and the cops time to be a ghost hey man come the on and then well be ghost the police sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning mind full of demons i dont wan na hear them anymore got me heartbrokenfine so many babies screaming cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being so they start smoking weed well never get our day until we learn to pray keep our
families in shape cause they all broke and why do ghetto birds die before we learn to fly some bodies elses child caught in guns smoking weed can all make a change so im told but i havent seen the change unfold i keep hoping please if you prefer to breathe communities in need of people that will lead keep your eyes open i can only say ill try until the day i die i promise to be wise with my heart open greed brings only misery a way to tragedy so i stay sucker free only a few chosen
rise rise my ghetto queen rise rise dont be afraid to try try too many of us died to the door to open wide my brother be wise stay focused on the prize though everybody dies we can only learn to take our anger and our hate control our mental state settle down and just set it straight maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes for we said it regret it later and let it escalate cause by then its too just late theres so much we can take theres only so much someone can
swallow and tolerate to the point that he just breaks snaps and thats all it takes youd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes but we aint its plain to go against with every artists comes the image he portrays and a picture that he paints but in the midst of all this anger and this angst never once did you hear me say im a gangster and i aint hear no complaints but i know that i will always continue to grow as long as i lead and never follow no one elses shadow there will never
be another me and that i can guarantee thats why the i remain sucker free to this day the game will never be the same no matter how much fame or success they attain there will never be another me and no matter what they do there will never be another you you can search but youll never find you can try to rewind time but in your hearts and your minds we will never die we are forever alive and we continue growing one day at a time dont be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and light searching for fortune and fame and super stardom all the jewelry all the cars whose crew is the hardest now the hiphop police the villains is watching and kids think beef is the only option outlaws born filthy guilty as charged my memories of khaddafi but makaveli lives on you think the industry is fun and no pity with guns and when your money is up thats when your enemies come so if he died and came back would he try to save rap we needing a change the drama remains i
spent my whole life fighting myself that i cant win so im inviting some help and every now and then i take rights from left im still just like a kid looking for stripes on my belt and that there is a fight in itself so i just pray and hope god take a like to myself no matter how much i try stay alive im gunna die mad still standing there in love with my pride heard frivolous beats we past that im trying to keep some income coming in and collect on my ass cap the rappers in
the game aint changed and i finally realized that we not in the same game the hating will never end so i guess ill deal wit it them with cop killers just some steel wit it the streets is military you got ta be a soldier got ta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers as they do what they got ta do to shackle and hold us so we got ta do what we got ta do to keep rolling one way at a time keep the faith in your mind and we continue growin one day
at a time damn between you and biggie was like whos gon na whos gon na who ruled the the kingdom and basically you know what im sayin it was like this is like an election it is an election you know what im sayin me and biggies situation was smaller than that me and biggies situation was like tupac shakur was shot several times in the chest other reporters talking then they fade slowly you know i wonder if theyll laugh when i am dead why am i fighting to live if im just living to fight why am
