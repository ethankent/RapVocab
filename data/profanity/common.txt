you know just trying to survive in the world bout to have a little boy or baby girl who knows anyway just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you you start thinkin about stufftryin to make the right moves so bust it out this is what i was thinkin check it yo the education of the lonchickalonnie lynn began began with time bein my bloodline is one with the divine in time brotha you will discover the light some say that god is black and the devils white well the devil is wrong and god is
whats right i fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear the rain aint gone but i can still see clear as a child given religion with no answer to why just told believe in jesus cuz for me he did die curiosity killed the catechism understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that i played to and became a slave to master self a rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health my mind had dealt with the books of zen tao the lessons koran and the bible to me they all vital and got truth
within em got ta read them boys you just cant skim em different branches of belief but one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em and use religion as an emblem when it should be a natural way of life who am i or they to say to whom you pray aint right thats who got you doin right and got you this far whether you say in jesus name or hum do allah long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you you let that show towards others in the things
you do cuz when the trumpets blowin elders surround the throne only gon get home only gon get home only gon get it baby chorus ceelo ive lived and ive learned i have taken and ive earned i have laughed ive cried i have failed and i have tried sunshine pouring rain found joy through all my pain i just wan na be happy with being me ceelo let me voice my concern so many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence subconciously
seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince ive finally come to the realization why black people in the worse place cuz its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place so i try to find the clue in you but evidently white folks know more black history than we do whyre we bein lied to i aint know our history was purposely hidden damn somethin in me wan na know who i am so i began my search my journey started in church it gave my heartache relief when i started to
understand belief hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets taught me survival from this evil im just gon na have to deal with and i felt like a fool when i tried to learn it in school it almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal takin elder advice read the bible the koran searched scrolls from the hebrew israelites hold on this aint right jesus wasnt white some leads were granted with insight and its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand he
still created with the imperfection of man so with followin i disagree by no means have i forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but i do know the devil aint no white man the devils a spiritual mind thats color blind theres evil white folk and evil you gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity but one side you gon na have to choose any chance to speak i refuse to misuse so how can you call yourself god when you let a worldly possession become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant
follow your lesson if a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own well ive lived and ive learned ive taken and ive earned i have laughed i have cried i failed and i have tried sunshine pourin rain i found joy through my pain just wan na be happybein me bein me this the city of chicago the state

the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes shed exercise paint and begin to read two years inna hole her soul grew weak away from people so long she forgot how to speak she discovered frredom is a unspoken sound and a wall is a wall and can be broken down found peace in the panthers she went on trial with one of the brothers she had a child with the foulness they would feed her hopin shes lose her seed held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed in need of a doctor from her stomach shes
bleed out of this situation a girl was conceived separated from her left to mother the revolution and lactated to attack hate cause federal and state was built for a black fate her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates they fabricated cases hoping one would stick and said she robbed places that didnt exist in the midst of threats on her life and being caged with aryan whites through dark halls of hate she carried the light i wonder what would happen if that woulda been me all of this so we could be free yeah i often

felt pitiful she had only learned to love through the physical inside it burned my heart turned i thought of what this man did she forgave him she grew to understand it her soul was tired and never really rested only with men through aggression said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason by speaking it she found freedom between me and you sometimes i wish a careless whisper serenade her without speaking a word because of you im stronger im afraid no longer i feel so alive in me you have liberated me she laid i
watched her breathe happy to be here not afraid to leave i couldnt conceive her not being here death in her face her not having fear less than a year she was diagnosed with it memories of that year so close and vivid happiness would only visit once in a while to watch an adult becoming a child somehow i knew shed make it the life of one so given early would god take it hurt she placed in hope and prayer hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair i stare with my eyes closed wonder when the body

only to be freed through death between me and you he spoke with his eyes tearfilled a lump in his throat his fear built my whole life it was in steel this aint the way that men feel a feeling he said he wish he could kill a feeling not even time could heal this is how real lifes supposed to be for it to happen to someone close to me so far wed come for him to tell me as he did insecurity held me i felt like he failed me to the spirit yelled help me id known
him for like what seemed forever about going pro we dreamed together never knew it would turn out like this for so long he tried to fight this now there was no way for him to ignore it his parents found out and hated him for it how could i judge him had to accept him if i truly loved him no longer he said had he hated himself through sexuality he liberated himself between me and you liberation peace can you speak your words of bedtime i was just saying to myself the other day most of believing the
