ninehundred forty thousand square miles of it damn its strange how change but when you look again ironically some is still the same but in these streets youll probably find a regularly dreaming paying attention to everything regularly scheming trying to calculate the next hustle without attracting heat there be so many different things that be going down in the streets where bodies get clapped floating in oceans in the streets its where the suffering can callous your emotion in the streets but parents pray for their children constantly hoping that their babies don t end up killed in jail

my hot sauce get your mind watching loot and get your life lost yo let us talk about being leaders or let us talk about leading anew how about lets talk about being a leader of the new school i do want us to look at how leaders are made right so leaders are not being made in the same way that they used to and when leadership is being made theres no sacrifice theres no scarring theres no embedding of pain theres certain things that have to go into leadership that will sustain it leadership is not all popularity
it is not all fun doin things behind the shadow of a leader right and another leader so part of my gifting to this generation is to invite them to know that there is a season and a time for everything right and do not rush your time do not rush your time some things have to be made through pain and not just through the glamour of life as we have here today wow say it again preach as we always aspire to aspire more greatly just know there will always be only one leaders of the new school
