penetration in the hood i took the ivory way in and yes im glad that keenan could not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone look in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players rappers they tend to be smilin because they swimmin in women most of em sick of favors they come in secret flavors thats why i envy omar because so far and thats some higher learning trying
ta excel with the brake on ill have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin and im a liar turnin jaded with no faith in any female thats askin what i was earnin i met this recent lady she knew a piece of sadey by spinners i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby cuz she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy now im out of both
and ive been thinkin of aleshia lately im all alone i got a feelin its on cuz nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces circling workplaces and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is they get to first bases then they get to retreating cuz if she cheatin he wan na know what the first trace is now you like macgyver cuz you sneakin around and she dont know that you there when you standin
right beside her i cant relate to that i had to take it back a couple a years when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it with and they lewis and a couple things that they true in and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do cuz its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife and i used to be eager to buy em the world maybe im confused about what i desire from girls
either way im all alone got a feelin its on cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone check and nowadays some girls are the type of person that will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin since i aint made them a purchase yet but theres logic behind it emotions double and they try to cover up like a mansion with the projects behind it i tend to freak with this i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin
and all she gave was a decent kiss thinkin she been spoiled but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days and come up with tin foil we could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing her reputations in jeopardy cuz it aint take her of that shopping to get her next to me collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me for thinkin that
exists i got a feeling im wrong nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone look if you a girl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so much more to my dudes at the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of the
speech coz im from the city where people be gettin lazy litterin in the streets and the club district is poppin like literally every week and promotersll push flyers money exchange hands liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans hustlers give you events bouncers give you pass directors give em a shot so girlsll give up the ass and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock daffy and bugs its all laughing and hugs til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was right back on the
bus its ashame cuz now at his rental she throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch you can see thats shes colder cuz he doesnt hold her fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder know that he tried ta told her that he couldnt mold her if this the type of chick you wan na be when you older i say if you a girl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so
much more to my dudes at the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of the speech coz now up north theres five artists deservin a listen and im one of em the other four you know who you are but if you got ta think through chances are that it aint you i singlehandedly carry out what you cant do and see i take a couple of breathers and then things come together on the spot like a couple
thats eager if you wan na pack a duffel and leave her go ahead i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers but uh the in the out whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill and every verse the man seem to kill you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill japan and brazil the audience acreaming and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill advances to deals financing appeals the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh if you a
girl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so much more to my dudes in the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of the speech coz uh yea get in my slick rick mode na mean im a tell ya a story real quick look she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man

song cuz i cant stay with a video girl and you betrayed your wealth got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself and i aint trying ta generalize every video girl you na mean say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you got ta accept the fact that theres times that you got ta better yourself you know as a person man i love to see my black women strong single independent doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers video you na mean its a wonderful thing baby so uh dont hate me
for this one ladies just take my advice you na mean cuz its like uh if she beautiful and honey dances and you always downtown making money transfers and anything the color of braces she get excited she always showing up at these places she get invited she a video girl yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december
im driving and shes like wheres my hi i swear that i never called you cause i really get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowing and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some
mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wan na get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since
im driving i ask her how to get the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda takin it
back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did
on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on
the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for carrabanna and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime voice drake i miss you most of aaaallll myy daarling gim me a second to gather my toughts strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spriing such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strolling
in the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by
the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handin them crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the and when they talk about they
past and lovers and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing southern smoke yeah ho its drake uh uh ho do that dance do that dance you special girl dont leave me baby to find another just like you wont be easy

so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this its not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist which means if goes bad i say i expected this and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate instead of understanding its a tune of hate the citys mine like oklahomas a sooner state and were gon na have to cross paths whether soon or late so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut you aint morris chestnut you lighter and less cut and lets be
honest by now you should be your own scholar you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler you got rappers being repetitive actors you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boi southern smoke yeah ren mof haha its drake man its drake manyeah ayo ren this that gritty here man ima half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean ho southern smoke very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing the
samples that they using cant get through the clearing ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it my fathers early careering forced my parents to split up my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus and he got back into doing what he was doing before us because money is an issue your son he gon miss you and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too now you looking for exes you aint never expect this you
end up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt and mommy ima support her i keep it all in order see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border but i got stress on my shoulders trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers its
stress my im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what i been through i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you picture when i was in school me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i was
into rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight but when someone called me a id punch them i couldnt help it now im grown i can say what it is its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids and your daddy want it very right i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white because black is black honey even if hes very light and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces i live it so the case is whether drake is way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist i got stress on my shoulders trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers its stress my im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just trying
to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best like girls with double ds i got ta lot on my chest theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test instead of staring at quizzes now its models with breasts and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician homie i probably could of been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo or maybe peteys assistant and my mindset is come and get me im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson get the handgun if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond that have you laying out on the curb they some hitmen last couple of months i done probably been around the world and back and i dont wan na question half the places nick been
i got stress on my shoulders uh trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder yeah young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older oh and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers yeah man its stress my im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this that gritty boy im just trying to live my life cuz got me winded over here man make a little money find a bunny to make my
wife cuz bo bo bo bo uh sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what im about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling its wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason its a lose lose
why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and wan na say that you aint around i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town you gon na try to try harder cuz try harder
cuz try trytrytry and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher than most of these rappers running the game concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash theres time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because im really tend to need what i spent in a
house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time i wasted late out at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winner so this album is a labor of love you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv thats exactly why i often get burned but im gon na try to you
gon na try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry uh what up yall soundtrack whats popping baby yall aint know i go by the name of lupe fiasco representing that first and fifteen jyea uh and this one right here i dedicate this one right here to all my homies out there grinding you know what im saying legally and illegally hahaha you know what im talking about so check it out first got it when he was six didnt know any tricks matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped landed on his

doing the thing no more guess me and the boy songz is the replacement ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay lets go yeah look its what you all been waiting for aint it your weekly entertainment for me to get a hold of this beat and go ahead claim it im about to paint a picture you go head frame it cause we getting seinfeld on some jerry and elaine i flow far from mediocre and if we talking cards i will fold em with the poker you and your whole crew are

when you meet drake i be in your face like no speaka la englis soon as you hear it you quote it they tryna be the one that i done left out the show with but trust me im aware and my cars right there is this interior enough for your ulterior motives cause if you like it you should stick with me my money good i aint ever had to flip a key a lot of ice a lot of cream like dicky d might cut the phone and disappear like mishy me but im tryna have you on
that trip with me sliding through henri bendel like its slippery and your exman is a hater officially probably cause he know im exactly what you wish hed be yeah thats the reason why he looking hard cause i done snatched the chips ahoy out his cookie jar he just mad cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a michael jordan rookie card let me address this pardon me while i fix couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix i guess he thought he couldve been gotti in the flicks but at this point
im just poking her body with a stick nowadays rapping is a childrens hobby and girls keep telling me im still as snobby i tell em myself who i am feeling probably just because i got a buzz like a building lobby it aint a song that your ass finna skip i tried to sell weed give me cash for the zip the way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car seems like she dont really need no gas for the trip millionaire shades fade with waves i smirk at a if he still rockin braids that just lets
me know that we aint on the same page and that goes out to every except trey ay im outta here baby they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me i wouldnt take it back nah not if you paid me mister bet you thats expensive cause its not a fugayze spittin that crock pot of bottomless gravy the is so nasty how is it tasting and you can probably find him walking out of a macys forget a girl they just thinking how to replace me exit with a joke leave these some hope
he took that ye beat and you put that in a choke well i think that i should leave out on this note keep your two cents i aint tryna leave you broke life of a don lights keep glowing coming in the club with that fresh on with something crazy in my arm arm and heres another hit barry bonds ion think they really ready for my wardrobe i show up right before the store close and blow the fee from my last four shows i do one song and use four flows she use to be a christian
before but now all she wan na do is shop for christian dior clothes like baby those are cute i adore those me and the salesman build a rapport so he understands tha fact that im spending off shore dough cash only transactions homie and please no receipts the feds like to explore those they cant audit if they dont know i bought it i been doin this for years homie thoroughly ive thought it through what it do i am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currencys imported were too late now too legitimate to hit

a talk with my uncle and he agreed that my privacy about the only thing i need back but its hard thinkin in polite flows when stephano polato suits are your night clothes and jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes and you still make it even when they say your flight close eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows life was so full now the just been lypod always said ill say it all on the right track but in this game you only lose when you fight back black diamond bracelets showing you the basics i cant
live and hold the camera someone got to tape this i make hits and like a thats married i aint miss hours from greatness im that close dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt transitioning from fitting in to standing out los angeles cabanas or atlanta south watch hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out so i park about houses down she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around so she wonders where
my mind is accounts in the minus and yet i role around the city like ya highness got reacting without a sinus cause what im working with is timeless and promoters trying to get me out to they club and say i have fun but i cant imagine how cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im right now and can get weird unless they all down and so i stay clear we from a small town and everybody talks and everybody listen and somehow the truth just always comes
up missing ive always been something that these labels cant buy especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul and silvia be telling taz damn drake fly and he just be like silly i know that was your bad how can you pass up on em he just take them records and he gas up on em wayne would probably put a million cash up on em surprised no one ever put your ass up on em oh they did po at least they tried to and thats what happen when you spitting what inside you but
slip up and shoot the wrong video and they think they can market you however they decide to nah before they told me to do me and dont listen to anybody that knew me cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me and if you think i changed in the slightest could have fooled me boy and to my city im the two three drug dealers live vicariously through me i quit school and its not because im lazy im just not the social type and campus life is crazy understand i could get money with

neither im going in where should i begin i dont even know maybe where my blunt ends an imma be a legend even when my life ends an imma be a legend even when this night ends til i do my thang hop up out it like biem i said im in so im nothing like them im going in and ima go hard im going in and ima go hard this is why i do this i think they call this uhm venting look uhh this is me still the same they want the hits i play the game
no auto tune but you can feel the pain it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein what up lil braw what up slum ville i hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still the fans thinking that we all signed for one mill equal opportunities rapping that is unreal that aint how it works that aint that how it goes and i be getting high to balance out the lows and i could use a writer to balance out my flows but i never share my thoughts this is all a knows and every
time i try it opens up my eyes these verses are a chance to remembered and reprised and i would be performing just as long as im alive so every word i utter will be mine dont believe the lies look me in my eyes please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me oh oh oh oh oh uhh i never cried when pac died but i probably will when hov does and if my tears
hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us and ill be standing in a puddle i stay away from that could land me in some trouble and ima keep it honest im so tired of being subtle its just me forty o and neek standing in a huddle staring at the members of my team who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme just know that im in debt for you defending all our dreams i hope you tell your family this aint what it seems but yall the reason for
a lot of my devotion you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless and know i pop bottles cause i bottle my emotions at least i put it all in the open dont believe the lies look me in my eyes please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me oh oh oh oh oh uhh look all yall we ignore feelings here premature millionaires welcome to my realest year yeah i swear we making
a killing here i should be on top of the world here just chilling here uh but its funny having fans who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game and realize when your there sometimes the dont feel the same yeah and plus things are just surreal at home people think ive changed just because my appeal has grown and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone i think im scared of what the future holds i
was wishing for some things and now am used to those every girl i meet thinks im groupie hoes the honesty of my music has left me too exposed all my old friends think i got a new crowd and people seem to notice every time i do smile i guess that mean they come few and far between even though am living out what you would call the dream yeah and my uncle aint even messaging me and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me i hope this isnt one of those forever things its
funny how money can change everything dont believe the lies look me in my eyes please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me oh oh oh oh oh uhh money just changed everything i wonder how life without it would go from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow lookin down from the top and its crowded below my fifteen minutes started an hour ago truth over fame you know i respect the blatant
when i hear them talking i just dont know what to make of it hate is so familiar to me i m slowly embracing it doesn t come natural bear with me it could take a bit yeah and my dreams are who i m racing with and you can see i m pacing it so that i m always chasing it wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with i hope that my success never alters our relationship yeah this life is something i would die for octobers own but its looking like july i
just wish they d let you try it first this time i m really going off fireworks today it begins i missed them before but wont miss them again i keep having the same dream and i think that i just realized what it means all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks every night its fireworks every night its fireworks all i see is fireworks all i see is fireworks taking off like fireworks taking off like fireworks i m just such a gentleman you should give it up for me look at how i m placing
all my napkins and my cutlery i could tell it wasn t love i just thought you with me who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me damn i kept my wits about me luckily what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me now all of a sudden these gossip brags wan na cover me and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me but i was curious and i ll never forget it baby what an experience you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious their
was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though you never see it coming you just get to see it go yeah i shouldve looked up in the sky at first now i can see it in her eyes fireworks everything the same but it feels different my dad called me up knowing that i still listen and he s still got his foot out guilt trippin it s been years though i just learn to deal with it for real me and my realtor
we built up a better rapport got my mother in a place with some better decor she searched the entire city i let her explore and now she s sayin she s more lonely than ever before how many of our parents marriages lasted i was only i bet i barely reacted i m flying back home for the heritage classic searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic let s stay together til we re ghosts i want to witness love i ve never seen it close yeah but i guess i got ta find it first
that s why i m really going off fireworks things have been so crazy and hectic i should have gotten back by now but you know how much i wanted to make it it s proabably better anyhow so if you got ta go if theres anything i should know if the spotlight makes you nervous if you looking for a purpose you put the tea in the kettle and light it put your hand on the metal and feel it but do you even feel it anymore i remember when you thought i was joking now i m all
singing karaoke further than i ve ever been so if you got ta go if there s any way i can help isn t it ironic that the girl i wan na marry is a wedding planner that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta damn of all the places you could go i just thought you d choose somewhere that has somebody that you know im always up too late i worry bout you there alone in that place you call your home warm nights and cold patron i hope you don t get
known for nothing crazy cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady i know they say the first love is the sweetest but that first cut is the deepest i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets secrets you were telling everybody but me don t be fooled by the money i m still just young and unlucky i m surprised you couldn t tell i was only trying to get ahead i was only trying to get ahead but the spotlight makes you nervous and you looking for a purpose i was
only trying to get ahead i was only trying to get ahead but the spotlight makes you nervous yesterday when we were getting high you were invited you wouldve liked it ii know you all too well i said that we could kiss the past goodbye but you werent excited theres no way to fight it you can stay but shawty here i go uh should i spend the weekend in vegas im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it i mean how could i forget my memories never faded i cant relate to these haters my
enemies never made it i am still here with who i started with the game needed life i put my heart in it i blew myself up im on some martyr carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship uh im with a money tree growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds its ironic cause my mother was a flourist and thats how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous its happening penny lane just like you said i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead uh huh thats word to
the millions that they putting up im trying to do better than good enough what am i afraid of this is suppose to be what dreams are made of but people i dont have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shitthey say you promised me you would never change you promised me you would never change uh am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on when got some for me to snap on now that im on i dont really want to worry about getting back on im just trying

told me the other day lisa told that she missed the old me which made me question when i went missing and when i start treating my friends different maybe it was the fast paced switch up or the two guns in my face during the stick up maybe cause the girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole up or the fact i havent seen em since they locked big rich up i know at the same time im quick to forget im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets burn it
