today far none he has an assassins mentality i said this once i said this when the trade went down and ill repeat it again whos starvin more for an nba world championship more than kobe bryant there is no one this guy is highly motivated what seperates kobe from the pack more than kobe bryant there is no one okay kkobe doin work on my shirt he the greatest on the court and im the greatest on the verse goin for the th ring like it was his st got ta get the gleamdo it for kareem so nice
my flow is so mean catch me at the game sittin next to goldstien kkobe bryant nikes purple gold strings kkobe in the game dunkin on the whole team blablack mamba attack conquer basketball beast rarap monsta crossover good or turnaround jumper or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers you know where its goin its goin down yo this is the lake show but dont drown though i call him king bryant now let the crown show definetly im just lost for words i mean hes amazing pass me the damn ball i dont need a pick at
all and dont worry bout my shot cause imma get that off yeah i drops on your double team then i drop on another team yeah you better guard me with caution and watch me work em like an option haha no such thing as exhaustionno time for resting cause i dont take breaks i just break records ha and i prefer the ball with seconds and i bet we gone win it all in seconds ya digg that is a guarentee apparently and please tell your defense dont never man to man with me double team triple team you
defenders tickle me but i never let them get to me literally step back and give em a aint no defending me and one guy certainly envious of the way bryants been playing lately lebron james ive been called to say that hes definetly the best player in our league to me in my eyes the best scorer in our in our league and i dont no if theres theres not another player that can accomplish some of the things that hes doing never take a day off catch you at the top of the key and get a j
