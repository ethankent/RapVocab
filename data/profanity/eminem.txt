dei la la la la la kids em its paul listen joel just called me and he said youre in the back behind his studio shooting your gun off in the air like its a shooting range i told you not to bring your gun around like an idiot outside of your home youre gon na get yourself in trouble dont bring your gun outside of your home you cant carry it on you leave your gun at home these ideas are nightmares to white parents whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings like
whatever they say has no bearing its so scary in a house that allows no swearing to see him walking around with his headphones blaring alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes a problem child what bothers him all comes out when he talks about his dad walkin out cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out his thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap he sags his pants dorags and a
stocking cap his stepfather hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose his house is a broken home theres no control he just lets his emotions go cmon sing with me sing sing for the years sing it sing for the laughter sing for the tears cmon sing it with me just for today maybe tomorrow the good lordll take you away entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum holy or unholy only have one homie only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me yet
everybody just feels like they can relate i guess words are a they can be great or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate its like these kids hang on every single statement we make like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum now how the did this metamorphosis happen from standin on corners and porches just rappin to havin a fortune no more kissin ass but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you to get their hands on every
dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns thats why these prosecutors wan na convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly but all they kids be listenin to me religiously so im signin cds while police fingerprint me theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me if im such a menace this doesnt make sense pete its all political if my music is literal and
im a criminal how the can i raise a little girl i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to youre full of too guerrera that was a fist that hit you they say music can alter moods and talk to you well can it load a gun up for you and it too well if it can then the next time you assault a dude just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols and they want to get one cause they think the cool not knowin
we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers of course the affectin our sales you ignoramus but music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our cheques in the mail its up aint it how we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any thing that we wanted thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing except for a dream and a rap magazine who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs or for anyone whos ever been
through in their lives till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe were nothin to you but were the in their eyes thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can oh you high baby yeah ya talk to me you want me

if there was some magic i could wave over the industry that could save it when im gone and bury to make sure the tradition carries on i would if i could only use this power for good i wouldnt not even if i could from the hood and im a hornet and ima only sting when im cornered and ima only sucker punch or swing without warning and swing to knock somebodys head off cause i know when they get up i wont get a chance to let off another punch im punkrock no ones punk dont give a
white pac so much when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil or grow up to be attila go nuts and be a killer and im something of a phenom one puff of the chron im unstoppable im alive im on top again theres no obstacle that i cant conquer so come along with us come on cause what you say is what you say say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it just remember how you said it when you was spraying it so who you playing with huh

it your way that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway cause this is my space you invade it live to regret it and you die trying to violate it around and youll get annihilated eyes dilated ha like my old lady cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean is different things depending on your mood if it swings think too many things little hit of dres weed i can do anything catch a contact then im gone and im back i speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad and i can
pull any string dont have to prove anything catch a contract on your head you headed west talk about dre you better get a vest then invest in something to protect your head and neck and its back and forth all day like red and meth i joke when i say im the best in the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest and if i ever do live to be a legend ima die a sudden death mics in the source aint holdin my breath but i suffocate for the respect fore i breathe to collect

feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wan na just give up but you got ta search within you you got ta find that inner strength and just pull that out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wan na just fall flat on your face and collapse bw intro yo left yo left yo left right left yo left yo left yo left right left yo left yo left yo left right left yo left yo left yo left right left verse
till i collapse i m spilling these raps long as you feel em till the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing them cause when i am not then ima stop pinning em and i am not hiphop and i m just not eminem subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop amoxacillin is just not real enough the criminal cop killing hiphop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners youre coming with me
feel it or not you re gon na fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up for shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a till the roof comes off till the lights go out till my legs give out can t shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps ima rip this till my bones collapse till the roof
comes off till the lights go out till my legs give out can t shut my mouth till the smoke clears out am i high perhaps ima rip this till my bones collapse verse music is like magic there s a certain feeling you get when youre real and you spit and people are feeling your this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it cause you may never get it again so while you re in it try to get as much as you can and when your run is over just admit
when its at its end cause im at the end of my wits with half this that gets in i got a list heres the order of my list that its in it goes reggie jayz tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when i m not put on this list the does not offend me thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me even though half you people got a problem with me you hate it but you
know respect you ve got to give me the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me verse soon as a verse starts i eat it at mc s heart what is he thinking how not to go against me smart and its absurd how people hang on every word i ll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve but i ll never be served my spot is forever reserved if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be
worse that s why i m clever when i put together every verse my thoughts are sporadic i act like i m an addict i rap like i m addicted to smack like i m kim mathers but i don t want to go forth and back in constant battles the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers so this is like a full blown attack i m launching at them the track is on some battling raps who want some static cause i don t really think that the fact that i m slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest so eminem nate dogg echo until the roof the roof comes off until my legs give out from underneath me i will not fall i will stand tall feels like no one can beat me hello boys and girls today were gon na talk about father and daughter relationships do you have a daddy ill bet you do whos your daddy daddy whatre you doing haha eminem hailie ok then everybody listen up im goin to hell whos comin with me somebody please help him i think my

me isnt work so its easy to misinterpret it at first cuz when i speak its tongue in cheek id yank my teeth before id ever bite my tongue id slice my gums get struck by lightning twice at once and die and come back as vanilla ices son and walk around the rest of my life spit on and kicked and hit with every time i sung like r kelly as soon as bump n grind comes on more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane aimed at the world
trade standin on ronnies grave screaming at the sky till clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade and thats pretty much the gist of itparents are pissed but the kids love it nine millimeter heater stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither crazy ha ha youre funny daddy is this thing on whered everybody go guess whos back back again ken is back tell some men rub my back rub my back rub my back rub my back eh wait hello eh goodnight ay yo what i tell

we truly love each other thats why we always fight and all we do is shove each other every other night and its clear it aint gon na change its pent up rage we both have we both feel like weve been upstaged by someone else weve both been someone elses someone else problem is neither one wants help its an addiction and it cant be fixed our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know and theyre
probably just tired of hearin it all the time on every song every lyric and every rhyme all the hoopla all of the whoopdy whoop what you put me through whoopdy doo but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up this time cause this time girl im telling you what you do it again im you up no matter what what you say what you do ima hunt you down til i find you no matter where you run ill be right there

smokes a bag of his weed and starts imagining things and he just cant see that hes manically depressed and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy as he turns on mtv and sees my face he dont exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage and its destroying him slowly cause he does not even know me even though he sees me everywhere he goes so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth so he extorts someone else to
get his dough and now hes acting like a bully so he tries to push and pull me but he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me cause it annoys him to see that i aint scared you aint no bully and i aint bowing to no bully i wont allow it aint gon na coward to no bully ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully and i
know it must be with you emotionally now im not trying to make no more enemies no more unfortunately theres so many other that just are they just keep pounding at me now that im down with suddenly now i got beef with this ja but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it and just make him say what he wants him to say but suge has irvs on a string and irvs so nervous that he says anything to this man to keep him at bay so now ja thinks that hes
so tough and murder incs the big bad wolf and they go huff and puff and blow our label down but our buildings made out of bricks so you aint taking out and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown so now you try to pull a race card and it backfires in your face hard cause you know we dont play that black and white plus this stylist that you when you was ecstasied up was just a man whos dressed up as a white you must be taking to much e now what bothers me the
most about hiphop is we so close to picking up where we left off with big and pac we just lost jam master j big l got blasted away plus we lost bugs slang toungue and freaky ta its like a neverending cycle that just seems to come full circle everybodys got ta be so hard im not excluding myself cause i been stupid as well i been known to lose it when someone says something smart but as we grow as men we learn to let go but then again theres only so much we can really stand we
all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes its no exception it goes for every man but if irv really gave a about ja like he claims he does hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs but he just keeps feeding him pills so if that e doesnt kill him someone from gunit will and i aint buzzed dawg im talking to you straight if the situation escalates any worse were gon na lose another soldier to this game and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in
cash that says i will get you back in halies name irvine get your boy off that e get at me dawg holla good mornin haha wake your mother asses up yo what is the what well come on then you know what time it is stop sleepin on my roof for whatever its worth its worth me havin my arse whipped cause ima have the last lift that ever gets arse squished i just cant get past these little pissants that wan na be rauny bad asses so bad and they so mad they cant stand it cause we
can and they cant spit haawk and they cant handle it like a man and thats when it just happens and i snap and its a wrap and its a scrap an then it isnt rap is it hiphop isnt a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that maybe im old fashioned but my pashion is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin believe me id much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when im pissed now but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic cause

sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times cuz i say so many rhymes it may seem like im goin too fast cuz my mind is racing and i could give a what category you place me long as when im pushing up daisies and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats when i hit the heavenly gates ill be cool beside jayz for every single die hard fan who embraced me im thankful for the talent in which god gave me and im thankful for the environment that he placed me believe
it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me in the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me it only made me what i am today see regardless of what anybody believes who hates me you aint gon na make or break me tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g youre only gon na be in for a rude awakening cuz sooner or later you haters are all gon na face me and when you face me with all the youve been saving to say to me you had all this time

and over but you got ta cop it when its hot its hot your hatin is undeniable stop it what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you wish to be saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over we seem to be approaching an age of the gross we all have this idea that we should move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better come on lets cut the enough lets get
it started lets start addressing this issue and open it up lets take this back to basement and we can discuss statements thats made on this tape and its whole origin of the music that we all know and love the music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy lets rewind it to when i was a boy on the east side of detroit crossing mile into warren into hick territory id like to share a story this is my story and cant no body tell it for me you will well inform me
i am well aware that i dont belong here youve made that perfectly clear i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere from belair shopping center just for stopping in there from the black side all the way to the white side ok theres a bright side a day that i might slide you may call it a past i call it hauling my ass through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks them good old notorious oh well known tracks so lets go back follow the yellow brick road as
we go on another episode journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place i once used to call home sweet home i roam the streets so much they call me a drifter sometimes i stick up a thumb just to hitch hike just to get picked up to get me a lift to mile and van and steal a god damn bike from somebodys backyard and drop it off at the park that was the half way mark to meet kim had to walk back to her mamas on chalmers after dark to sneak me in
the house when im kicked out my moms thats about the time i first met proof with goofy gary on the steps at osbourne handing out some flyers he was doing some talent shows at centerline high i had told him to stop by and check this out sometime he looked at me like im out my mind shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike we was on the same that big daddy kane with
compound syllables sound combined from that day we was down to ride somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line so lets go back follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place i once used to call home sweet home my first year in th grade cant forget that day at school it was cool till your man mc shan came through and said that pumas the brand cause the clan makes troops it was rumors but man god damn they flew mustve
been true because man we done banned they shoes i had the new ones the cool j ice land swayed too and we just through them in the trash like they yesterdays news guess who came through next xclan debut professor x vanglorious exists in a state of red black and green with a key sissies now with this being a new trend we dont fit in crackers is out with cactus albums blackness is in african symbols and medallions represents black power and we aint know what it meant me and my man howard and butter we would go
to the mall with em all over our necks like were showing em off not knowing at all we was being laughed at you aint even half black you aint supposed to have that homie let me grab that and that flavor flave clock we gon na have to snatch that all i remember is meeting back at manixs basement saying how we hate this how racist but dope the x clans tape is which reminds me back in me and kim broke up for the first time she was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
at our school who thought i was cool cause i rapped so she was kinda eyeing me and oh the irony guess what her name was aint even gon na say it plus the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs the bombest god damn girl in our whole school if i could pull it not only would i become more popular but i would be able to kim off at the same time but it backfired i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy and thats
the last i ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl but ive heard people say they heard the tape and it aint that bad but it was i singled out a whole race and for that apologize i was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a hoe so lets go back follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place i once used to call home sweet home step by step heart to heart left right
left we all fall down step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it even if it means goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless
i absolutely have to im supposed to set an example i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em if some ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em that ja i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it it was crazy this went way beyond some jayz and nas and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it this aint what im in hiphop for its not why i got in it that was never my object for someone to get killed why would i wan na destroy something i help build it wasnt my intentions my intentions were good i went through my whole career without ever mentionin and that was just out of respect for not runnin my mouth and talkin about something that i knew nothing about plus dre told
me stay out this just wasnt my beef so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while hes all over tv down talkin a man who literally saved my life like it i understand this is business and this just isnt none of my business but still knowin this could pop off at any minute cause there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it the gets escalated it
aint just words no more is it its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin we actually tried to stop the and ja beef from happenin me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him and asked him not to start it he wasnt gon na go after him until ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him it smash em mash em and let him have it meanwhile my attention is pullin in other directions some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk has an
erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record but now hes the game up cause one of the ways i came up was through that publication the same one that made me famous now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin well it that can get it too him then but im so busy being pissed off i dont stop to think that we just inherited s beef with murder inc and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like
either of us mind we still have soldiers thats on the front line thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders never to extort us strictly to show they support us well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show them we love em back and let em know how important it is to have runyan avenue soldiers up in our corners their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered it aint worth it
i cant think of a perfecter way to word it then to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict ill walk away from it all before i let it go any further but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin off at the jaws well then i can cause frankly im sick of talkin im not gon na let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of
america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all it feels so good to be back i scrutinize every word memorize every line i spit it once refuel reenergize and rewind i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind i exercise my right to express when i feel its time its just all in your mind what you interpret it as i say to fight you take it as imma whip someones ass if you dont understand dont even bother to ask a father who has
grown up with a fatherless past who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has or at least shows no difficulty multitask and in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half of his career typical manure moving past that mr kisses ass crack hes a class act rubber band man yea he just snaps back come along follow me as i lead through the darkness as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed carry
on give me hope give me strength come with me and i wont steer you wrong put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog to the light at the end of the tunnel we gon na fight we gon na charge we gon na stomp we gon na march through the swamp we gon na mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors cmon all the people up top on the side and the middle come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little just let it gradually build from the front
to the back all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black dont matter what color all that matters we gathered together to celebrate for the same cause dont matter the weather if it rains let it rain yea the wetter the better they aint gon na stop us they cant we stronger now more than ever they tell us no we say yea they tell us stop we say go rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gon na let em know stomp push shove mush bush until they bring our troops home
cmon imagine it pouring its raining down on us mosh pits outside the oval office someones tryina tell us something maybe this is god just sayin were responsible for this monster this coward that we have empowered this is bin laden look at his head noddin how could we allow something like this without pumping our fists now this is our final hour let me be the voice in your strength and your choice let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise try to amplify the times it and multiply by six teen million people are equal at
this high pitch maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech let the president answer a higher anarchy strap him with an ak let him go fight his own war let him impress daddy that way no more blood for oil we got our own battles to fight on our own soil no more psychological warfare to trick us to thinking that we aint loyal if we dont serve our own country were patronizing a hero look in his eyes its all lies the stars and stripes theyve been swiped washed out and wiped and replaced with his own face
mosh now or die if i get sniped tonight you know why cause i told you to fight and as we proceed to mosh through this desert storm in these closing statements if they should argue let us beg to differ as we set aside our differences and assemble our own army to disarm this weapon of mass destruction that we call our president for the present and mosh for the future of our next generation to speak and be heard mr president mr senator do you guys hear ushear us hailie there i gothinking of you again you dont

with time spent emotion grows in the beginning friends we decided to roll so whos responsible when you get excited explode and obies grinning then you invite that obies cold but the gon talk they gon hate we established this way before we became mates so whats required is that you chill with all that fire get your desire when i retire spend some time with me say that youll be mine i never thought id find someone to be mine lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line spend some time with me say that youll
be mine i used to say i never met a girl like you before still aint got a clue as to who you truly are almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters till you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls if you recall i used to
treat you as a groupie broad when we i refused to even take my jewelry off but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on you started getting moody on me pretty soon wed argue and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly cupid could shoot another one of them god damn darts at me its true that i got shot in the heart but
when someone seems too good to be true they usually are but see when youre in it its too hard to see till you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach up under the seat as your heart starts to beat before you make a decision thats life altering and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring in most cases stats attitude is fuckabitch my only motive is to get head and a but you was different thought we shared a
covenant even held your hand in public we sufferin because of this shorty on some whole notha other tryna play sick thinkin imma trick off rick ill admit i was caught in the mix down to commit feed you the best of me i shoulda fed you we started off closer than close but who coulda predicted to know your triflin ways woulda stopped our growth and the final result back in that same boat i ask myself do i love these hoes no em introduced us this is tanya tanya this is then slid off and left her to
kick it with me i complimented her i said you have very nice lips with my imagination i could see her suckin my we played the phone game a week later changed fast had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline penthouse full of imported you know how i grind she got to talkin talkin like an opportunist too why talk when suckin my is the real career move said shes an inspiring actress she do videos for practice yeah yeah know how many times i done

that i try to do that the more it backfires on me all the things growing up as daddy that he had to see daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me but things have got so bad between us i dont see us ever being together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers but then of course everything always happens for a reason i guess it was never meant to be but its just something
we have no control over and thats what destiny is but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream now hush little baby dont you cry everythings gon na be alright stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya daddys here to hold ya through the night i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why we feel how we feel inside it may seem a little crazy pretty baby but i promise mamas gon be alright ha its
funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your mom
was saving money for you in a jar tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mammas heart and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of mile on novara and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met
dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it and you and lainnie were too young to understand it papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud now im sitting in this empty
house just reminiscing lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now wow i guess you pretty much are and daddys still here lainnie im talkin to you too daddys still here i like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it shh mamas only gone for the moment and if you ask me to daddys gon na buy you a mockingbird imma give you the world imma buy a diamond ring for you imma sing for you ill do

a private world where they can be alone are you calling me are you trying to get through are you reaching out for me like im reaching out for you im just so depressed i just cant seem to get out this slump if i could just get over this hump but i need something to pull me out this dump i took my bruises took my lumps fell down and i got right back up but i need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up i dont know how
or why or when i ended up in this position im in im starting to feel distant again so i decided just to pick this pen up and try to make an attempt to vent but i just cant admit or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet and i know some so hard to swallow but i just cant sit back and wallow in my own sorrow but i know one fact ill be one tough act to follow one tough act to follow ill be one tough
act to follow here today gone tomorrow but youd have to walk a thousand miles in my shoes just to see what its like to be me ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to feel your pain you feel mine go inside each others minds just to see what we find look at through each others eyes but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh they can all get just stay true to you so dont let em say you aint beautiful oh they can all get just stay true to you

need no man servant trying to follow me around and wipe my ass laugh at every single joke i crack and half of them aint even funny like ha marshall youre so funny man you should be a comedian god damn unfortunately i am but i just hide behind the tears of a clown so why dont you all sit down listen to the tale im about to tell hell we dont got ta trade our shoes and you aint got ta walk no thousand miles in my shoes just to see what its like to be me ill be

sick thoughts the things you could do with your lipstick gloss put it on my til the tip looks orange keep going keep going banana banana banana banana banana im a goat and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes this is the part i was worried about everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes and im in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes and everyones telling me what i
should do and how i should come out and what to rap about and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i got ta get out and im not sure how this is gon na come off theyre probably gon na think that im coming off as cocky haha like i just started giving a what you really think about me see the thing about me is you dont really know a thing about me everyones making a stink about me like theres some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and i feel like im more comfortable around them than i do my own neighbors but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave but why does it seem like im not even put up in the same category as other emcees so when weezy says that hes better than jayz please be that just subliminally means he thinks jiggas the best and that hes the only one up in that league see and its easy just to consider
me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowing god damn well that im one of the best rappers who ever lived period im a goat and i dont mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazinesll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes maybe
they figure that im on my way out the game so they got ta go try to find em a new eminem or a new shady if they think its gon na happen man i thought i was crazy or maybe i could be takin it wrong and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that paul walls white cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight
and bubba sparxxx he just wont write because hes so caught up in that snow white that timbaland cant even get him in the studio hes so gone off that coke right and its so sad cause hes dope right americas next great white hope right so now they feel like they got ta come up with some corny ass white rapper show right and which im still havin mixed feelings about they said itd be real im just spillin it out theres somethin about a white boy talking black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth
and i love when the say that tiger woods isnt it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black and im the one whos got ta catch all the flack offa that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parents had all got to likin me now when suddenly i wasnt such a bad guy all of the hatred for me mustve died thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty
faggoty faggoty gays and anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy not raggedy andy and andy and andy and angelina jolie is just another ho and brad is a sucka because once i her she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby you know what i say no you better save some of them kids from madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you want a shady well you got it man i aint apologizin for im a goat and i dont mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you
think and these magazinesll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes man im takin my ball and goin home man is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause im a goat so dont worry im out the game and yall can sit and argue about whos the best but yall know that
im a goat and like i said im one of the best before you get your panties in a bunch but before i go id like to say you very much to everybody who wasnt there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and yall aint got ta say it just think it cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know im a goat hahahaha im out yall its been real peace im a little nutty and i know it but if you go back
and take a look at my history you will see that im not the only one whos off his rocker there were many before me i was always labelled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed i grow to be but if you take a look at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree haha alright look ima tell you the story from my side maybe youll understand check it out you done witnessed unexplainable too insane to explain people run from what the just dont get maybe shady shoulda just
hit em with a little bit did i spit too soon should i of spoon fed em it but i was just so eager to prove i was even worth being in the same league or the room with of the people of whom i was in every now and then i look up like i was seeking approval was it because of the pigment of my skin or was it a figment of my imagination maybe it bothered me more than it did them maybe it wasnt a big deal back then but to me it was see what
it was was i had developed the complex from being judged proof spit his verse now im next lets see who im in the booth staring back to see whos mugs i get a reaction from usually the first thumb was from proof and the rest of the group backed him up and no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont
fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree ever since my mother was pregnant with her second egg cause she said that i had a baby sister who fell out of the window i was too young to remember kansas city projects i was like and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogie if it was the projects in missouri cause thosere my best friends until isaac took
my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back and ended up getting jumped and cut in the gut with a switch and some stitches which is still to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture of a fictitious little sister who never existed and this is why part of my lifes so twisted but i can never be as sick as that is and by the way that pictures one of my relatives sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy
but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree i said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain to see why everything i say is so insane whats different about my brain that separates me from other players in this game on the surface it may seem like a scheme or some sort of scam for me
to get some damn sympathy but thats the last thing i need is for people to walk around feeling sorry for me me and im not a g never claimed to be i gave my vest to cashis hell need it more than me but well see cause we aint lookin for beef but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree i
said sometimes i feel like its just me sometimes i feel like im going crazy but take a look at my family cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree thanks its been real i love you but i just cant deal with the stress this game is giving me but before i go you know i cant close the show without no closure so before i leave yeah i just want to take the time out to basically say rest in peace to deshaun holton thats my heart man dr dre for giving me the oppurtunity just

over again how you just brushed me off and left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search maybe i needed to grow up a little first well looks like i hit a growth spurt but i am coming for closure don t suppose an explanation i m owed for the way that you turned your back on me just when i may have needed you most oh you thought it was over you could just close the chapter and go about your life like it was nothing you ruined mine but you seem to be
doing fine well i ve never recovered but tonight i betcha that whatcha bout to go through s tougher than anything i ever have suffered can t think of a better way to define poetic justice can i hold grudges mind saying let it go this hearts saying i will once i bury this alive hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset hook sarah jaffe i flee the scene like it was my last ride you see right through oh you had me pegged the first time you can see the truth but its easier to justify
whats bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy i just hate to be the bad guy verse eminem and to think i used to think you was the to think it was you at one time i worshipped think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it not this time you better go and get the sewing kit finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew sic knit wit thought some time had past and id forget it forget it you left our family in shambles you expect me to just
get over him pretend he never existed may be gone but hes not forgotten and dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya youre wrong and that was rotten and the way you played him same you did to me cold have you any idea the that ive gone through feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to not once you call to ask me how im doing letters you dont respond to em it im coming to see you and gee who
better to talk to than you the cause of my problems my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you poof then im gone voosh and verse eminem ive been driving around your side of this town like frickin hours and minutes now finally i found your new address park in your drive feel like i been waiting on this moment all of my life and its now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house see its sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i aint here for ya empathy i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potential i peeked continue to peep still bent low keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this you dont plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got
your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans ironys spectacular huh now whos a you punk and heres your bronco hat you can have that back cause they suck its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it were in a car right now wait here comes my favorite lyric im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey heres a sequel to my
mathers lp just to try to get people to buy well hows this for publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this youll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell i even have your initials i initially was gon na bury you next to my brother but it since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near i hope we dont get stopped no license i fear that sirens i
hear guess on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea as cops appear in my drivers side mirror oh god police ah hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well got ta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you slim this is for him and frank ocean hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again outro eminem i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend im the nightmare you fell asleep
in and woke up still in im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again backs to the wall i m stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i m talking a lotta but i m backing it all up but in my head there s a voice in the back
and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i m the ringing in your ears i m the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal chords after your concerts i m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged grab for some water but i m that pill that s too jagged to swallow i m the bullies you hate that you became with every you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper s persona s half a fa ade and matthew and stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til it s gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don t stop after they call
you biggest laughing stock of rap who can t call it quits when it s time to walk away i m every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if theres anything you have left to say unless it makes an impact then dont bother so before you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop so one last time i m back before it fades into black and it s all over behold the final chapter in the saga trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the
magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark as we pick up where the last mathers left off dont kill me hurry the up thank you go go go what the f uck what the are you doing bail on me you aw you got ta be kidding me are you kidding me get off haha the parking lot ah let me see your hands pranks over it whats your name marshall whos your daddy
i dont have one my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap im loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum about to explode all over the canvas back with the yoda of rap in a spasm your music usually has them but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt follow you must rick rubin my little padawan a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts of entertaining but docile and impossible to
explain and im also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh its on a rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small it says ever since i drove a lincoln with white walls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so as long as im on the clock punching this time card hip hop
aint dying on my watch but sometimes when i m sleeping she comes to me in my dreams is she taken is she mine don t got i don t care don t have two to give let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone cause there s no rhyme or no reason for nothing nah whats your name marshall who s your daddy i don t know him but i wonder is he rich like me ha ha has he taken any time to show you what you need to live no if he
had he wouldn t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad i wouldn t be so mad my attitude wouldn t be so bad yeah dad im the epitome and the prime example of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and makes you want to get up and start dancing even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank lamping in my kmart mansion i m in the style department with a pile in my cart ripping the
aisle apart with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat killing spree your honor i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hip hop is the devils music is that me it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that dont honk but every time i speak you
hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me cause its the its the time of the season when hate runs high and this time i wont give it to you easy when i take back whats mine with pleasured hands and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing whats your name shady who s your daddy i don t give a but i wonder is he rich like me doubt it ha has he taken
any time to show you what you need to live so yeah dad lets walk lets have us a father and son talk but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block without me knocking your block off this is all your fault maybe thats why im so bananas i appeal to all those walks of life whoever had strife maybe thats what dad and son talks are like cause i related to the struggles of young america when their parents were unaware of their troubles now theyre ripping out their hair again its hysterical i chuckle cause everybody bloodies
their bare knuckles yeah uh oh better beware knuckle heads the sign on my hustle says dont knock the doors broken it wont lock it might just fly open get coldcocked you critics come pay to me a visit misery loves company please stay a minute kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out mister mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word cause im promoting my passion til im passed out completely
brain dead rainman doing the bankhead in a restraint chair so shoot me a look it better be a blank stare or get shanked in the pancreas im angrier than all of the reindeer put together with chief keef cause i hate every thing yeah even this rhyme and quit tryna look for a reason for it that aint there i still am a criminal ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals the last mathers lp done went diamond this time im predicting this one will go emerald when will the madness end how can it when theres no
method the pad and pen the only message that i have to send is dad im back at it again whos your daddy you groupie pick up the goddamn phone where the were you tuesday with who you say i wasnt at the studio whatcha do screw dre you went there looking for me boo that excuse is to lame keep playin me you gon end up with a huge goose egg you fake lyin you never told me you knew drake and lupe you wan na lose two legs you tryin to flip this on me if i spent

goal post and if i dont got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what they said i was washed up and got a blood bath im not a rapper im an adapter i can adjust plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust so floors open if youd like to discuss top in this and if i dont make the cut what like i give a i will light this up like im driving a truck to the
side of a pump to hop in and gun it like gunit without the hyphen im hyping em up and if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut and i look like i might just give up eh mightve mistook me for bowing out i aint taking a bow im stabbing myself with a knife in the gut while im wiping my butt cause i just on the mic and i like getting cut i get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut cause im a fight til
i die or win biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting now draw a circle around it and put a line through it its survival of what so get your ideas stack your ammo but dont come unless you come to battle im mad now jump in the saddle this is it its what you eat sleep and live breathe your whole existence just consists of this refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick i dont do this music i lose my

say no matter if its true ill say it all for you i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling why am i so differently wired am i a martian what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in cause i dont belong in this world thats why im scoffing at authority defiant often flying off at the handle at my mom no dad so i am noncompliant at home at school im just shy and awkward and i dont need no goddamn psychologist tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying
problems thinking he can try and solve them im outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talking to myself either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet trying not to be noticed cause im crying and sobbing i had a bad day at school so i aint talking some shoved me into a locker cause he said that i eyeballed him and if you fall ill get you there ill be your savior from all the wars that are fought inside your world please have faith in my words cause this is
my legacy legacy eh this is my legacy legacy eh theres no guarantee its not up to me we can only see this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling why am i so differently wired in my noggin cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling cause i obsess on everything in my mind small bothers me but not my father he said sayonara then split but i dont give a im fine long as theres batteries in my walkman nothings the matter
with me look on the bright side at least i aint walking i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment complex on a ten speed which ive acquired parts that i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start but if this is all there is for me life offers why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience what about them rhymes ive been jottin theyre kinda giving me confidence instead
of tryna escape through my comics why dont i just blast a little something like onyx to put me in the mood to wan na fight and write songs that say what i wan na say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on who wouldve knew from the moment i turned the mic on that i could be iconic and my conquest is word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest this is my legacy legacy eh this is my legacy legacy eh theres no guarantee its
not up to me we can only see this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome cause if i wasnt i wouldnt be able to work words like this and connect lines like crosswords and use my enemys words as strength to try and draw from and get inspired off em cause all my life i was told and taught i am not by you wack giant sacks of lying dog now you shut up

just my opinion if it contradicts how im livin put a in your rearend thats why every time you mention a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform im flattered you thought i was that important but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down id just zoneout good luck tryin to convince a blonde its like telling gwen stefani that she sold out cause i was trying to

cause youre my mom though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on but agree to disagree that gift from me up under the christmas tree dont mean to me youre kicking me out its degrees and its christmas eve little prick just leave ma let me grab my coat anything to have each others goats why we always at each others throats especially when dad he us both were
in the same boat youd think that itd make us close nope further away it drove us but together headlights shine a car full of belongings still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old and thats when i realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but cause
to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though cause you aint even get to witness your grand babies grow but im sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though cause now i know its not your fault and im not making jokes that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time its on the radio and i think of nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us and how i just wanted
you to taste your own but now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow and im way too old to cry the is painful though but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have cause one thing i never asked was where the my deadbeat dad was it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every
address but id have flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas someone ever moved them from me that you coulda bet your asses if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap them and although one has only met their grandma once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers me her and nate we introduced you hugged you and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me as we
pulled off to go our separate paths and i saw your headlights as i looked back and im mad i didnt get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad so mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to lay it before im dead the stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt i guess were crashing so if im not dreaming i hope you get this message that ill always love you from afar cause

whence it came but the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing i can feel the heat rising everything is on fire today is a painful reminder of why we can only get brighter the further you put it behind ya but right now im on the inside lookin out cause im standin in the flames its a beautiful kind of pain settin fire to yesterday find the light find the light find the light yesterday was the tornado warning todays like the morning after your world is
torn in half you wake in its wake to start the mourning process and rebuilding youre still a work in progress todays a whole new chapter its like an enormous asthma thunderstorm has passed ya you weathered it and poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal and hit the corner fast the more asserted never looking back may hit the curb but every day is a new learning curve as
you steer through life sometimes you might not wan na swerve but you have to to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your ass and threw dirt on your casket but youve returned from the ashes and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline and while youre burning the past standing in the inferno and chant youre so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life and its as though you
feel youve died cause youve been killed inside but yet youre still alive which means you will survive although today you may weep cause youre weakened and everything seems so bleak and hopeless the light that youre seekin it begins to seep in thats the only thing keepin you from leapin off the mothafreakin deep end and im pullin for you to push through this feeling and with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that youre willing to forgive em even after all the you been put through this
feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down cause youre so over em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling as time passes things change every day but wounds wounds heal but scars still remain the same but tomorrow todays going down in flames throw the match set the past ablaze so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
perspire from the heat exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief and as you say goodbye to the grief its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell but youve extinguished this living hell still a little piece of you dies as you scream i feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn rising a phoenix from the flames i have learned from fighting fights that werent mine not with fists but with wings that i will fly im getting by with my wicked ways im loading up and im taking names i wan na dig my
way to hell i wan na dig my way to hell guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder ever heard of aspergers its a rare condition its what youre suffering from when you simply dont care if its an degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning and you cant see the s hair is frizzing cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your chevrolet prizm the devil aint on a level same as him picture someone who revels in straight masochism and imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping

but i cant even change the station the same ones playin on eight channels i lay awake in shambles im startin to hallucinate im havin all these visions of us at each others wakes in caskets and suddenly i wake and thats when i know i saw two white coffins in my dreams last night i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointing toward the light saw my old sweetheart she said honey im back just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone give me one more bottle for the pain give me one more
for the memories give me one more ill make it taste like a steak itll help alleviate itll soothe this ache of trying to fake that shes really shes really coming back and its been a while now but i finally realize how much reality sucks but its just something about our love im still in denial now dealing with the finality of it and its making me crazy thinking of the days we spent and how ill never hold you again aint i can do about it now my head is overcrowded with these clouded memories and i cant
seem to get you out it and how the do you sleep comfortably knowing what you done did to me huh did it even occur to you that i loved you completely deep and madly head over heels for you was you and me once used to be together forever it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream we was supposed to die together and its killing me so much when i sleep i wake up dead must be why i saw two white coffins in my dreams last night i saw my lord jesus with his
hands pointing toward the light saw my old sweetheart she said honey im back just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone feels like a close its coming to am i gon na do its too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came a long from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinkin my name was fault cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dog gangsta nah courageous balls had to change my style they said im way too soft and i sound like az nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i went against it it was ingrained in me that i wouldnt amount to a shitstain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong
in this game i pondered i just wan na play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tugowar wages on i dont wan na seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon but sometimes you got ta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off keep pluggin its your only outlet and your only outfit so you know theyre gon na talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like ive already
said this a kabillion eighty times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really wan na say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet cha feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid ta i was a afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out afraid id never be found i dont wan na go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house
with tip toed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is near guts over fear i shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round and let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear feels like a close its coming to am i gon na do its too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know i know what its like i was there once single parents hate your appearance did
you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it wasnt until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit hard as learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain ive caused but what am i gon na do
when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows and im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but id rather make not afraid than make another we made you uh and i dont wan na seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise
pray to god i just opened enough eyes later on gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use thatll make ya strong enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt just havin to balance my dang self when on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma cause that gave me the strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium least i made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day
was done so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song and everything youre scared to say dont be afraid to say no more from this day forward just let them aholes talk take it with a grain of salt and eat their faces off the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when im gone and to think i was a i was a afraid to make a single sound afraid
i would never find a way ooout afraid id never be found i dont wan na go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tip toed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is near guts over fear i shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round and let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear another day another hotel the inside of its nice though
oh well this is my life so as i go and try to close for the nights show see how far that line goes still blows my mind show business guess ill just never get so this just always feels so weird to this day because all i ever did was just say the i wouldve wanted to hear other people say to me when i was a kid so please dont make me some type of hero cause i will say some inspirational in a real way but still will have a field day with some of the up
in the world and tell it to suck the cause i still make fun of a sit someones in like a son of a at anothers expense im relentless as when it comes to this pen i struggle with coming to my senses stuck on the fence on a balance beam if i seem unbalanced its challenging but my conscience allows me to think the most foulish childish things without even blinking without even thinkin about all the stinkin amounts of people that seem to be reachin in the crowds im scream in the palace sold out this evening but
now its lay me down to sleeping is it really my soul to keep or have i sold it cheap is it greed do i take more than i need when i joke about leavin but keep over achievin because whats stolen from me barely broke even its a fine fine line its a fine fine line so i notice how i paint myself and through my hair when ordeals im so vain i want my respect but ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect till i sit in the dark and i reflect and my reflection shows
what its like here cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights yeah its like a nightmare i said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare and i dont like how i see myself so i open the bible to isaiah cause i swear to christ there are nights where i stay up at night just to say a prayer twice just to make sure god hears cause this ice layer ice skate on the nice way puting it but i like staying feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player i got a nice pair of
dice here sealed off in my lair away from the good safe place to sit and talk from in this house its quite bare but it aint when you cant leave it and i feel so isolated nice i made it but its like i payed the price of fame twice i hate it so i about my life then make another song its a cycle aint it then i wonder why i stay famous keep walkin the line this gold fish poke gets old but especially when you dont know if your conscience is sayin i told you so
you dont even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier or if you sold your soul its a fine fine line its a fine fine line and from here you look so small hovering high above us all please come back to me i still remember the times when they were simpler than the rhymes of vanilla ice were when i was just killin the mics ill never forget what that feeling was like i miss those times now when i was just starting out without a dime and now im diamond cant even stage dive in

i could endure the pressure collapse and crumble perhaps relapsing under that well thats a bunch of crap in the clutch im the captain crunch of rap and im sick of acting humble thats enough of that that cut the sack like its a natural reaction thats why im actually trapped in this shoving match cause push keeps coming to that i can keep getting my ass kicked keep it coming back like a sarcastic crumpled sack of so mad disgruntled had some struggles yeah but that passionate hungers back the fantastic juggling act and the way i flip my
tongue on the track its like verbal acrobatics but in fact last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic i crashed my hovercraft after i strapped the duffel bag to my back and stuck the massive punchin bag in it an elastic bungee strap proper plaster a thumb tack and a piece of plastic bubble wrap went spastic and snapped jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid stumbled back recovered back flipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat and for my last trick lunge on back lash on a nasa shuttle flap snapped
the rudder in half chuckled and laughed buttaled my last rebuttal and just asked him to come crash and i go grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat rubbed my magic mushroom tat fell off then splat get up from that face taped to a waste paper basket throw up then gas lungs collapse and thats more likely than finding someone thats couple of shots of j ger public intoxication disfuckincombobulation flooded with thoughts of anger while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin youre top ten aint cha stop cause

loose unloading the stockpile a mental projectile i aim like a reptile i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating how many times will it take you before you realize youre fading fading from existence cause simulations are dead theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read so put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor while i hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty
thor words can weigh a ton therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one yeah its another there are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side but i see no borderline from under this colorblind and some will probably never hold peices of the sacred but then im finally about to put an end to the hatred the world would never endure to arguing awaking to the abscence of unity is startling oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do you can not beat someone thats better
than you so quit trying to the outcome we want nothing despicable so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and youre dull its time you faced this here taste this straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles the date of my birth on the earth the deliverence of a starchild rest with formidable talent and versitility but with such a power there comes a responsibilty to infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear to form an alliance is something even
the giants fear so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend yeah its another you know i dont understand why we all just cant get along you hate me but you know me and what i stand for no so then why do you speak for me and every other white man when you that were your enemy on the floor lies a broken door cause im not to be spoken for stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore rarely do you see the lighter side of me i try to
be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry but ive apologies are exhausted feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted so who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted pull up the quick these we hate him these are past us huh always fighting for the position of top dog that spots already occupied and i dont play leapfrog cause i do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine but im always having to proove myself time after time oh how i never understand how
a man could be outcast judged from the past and hes put last and bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin and mutterin words with no meaning attack me side im like danny kdanny kane here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please ive got a craving im the man yo alright yo im possessed by evil demons that torture me while im sleeping i keep dreaming of death and im hearing people screaming the devils spirits trapped inside me and i want it out im on the couch bleeding
to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit im lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like someones holding me there i feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes tripping over odd bodies of dead lushes bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house
melts my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters caught a piece of shrapnel in the adams apple two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum it got silent then all these voices said come follow me into the pits of hell i heard em yell welcome to the norman bates motel i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother covered in dry blood head still dented

we will subside we will subside and hatred will release and everything will just crush that peace well when we crush that peace we start hatin each other but remember you are my brother and you are my sister just like im a mister i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her i kissed her i placed it on her cheek and she didnt come back til next week now it was next week and she was back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she was my girlfriend we started going out but thats okay because we
were black and white blacks and whites they sometimes mix but black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks so ima say like this dont date a black girl take it as a diss if you want but if you dont ima tell you like this i surely wont never date a black girl because blacks only want your money and that aint funny so ima say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because its green and thats cash
so get outta here cause i dont need your ass i said that before but thats okay because like i said youre a black girls and white girls just dont mix because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks white girls are good i like white girls i like white girls all over the world white girls are fine and they blow my mind and thats why im here now telling you this rhyme cause black girls i really dont like we dont mix its like riding a bike when youre peddling hard uphill both ways you
know its kinda hard and thats why i say to you im giving you a little advice dont date a black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice you wont ever do it again because theyll take your money and that aint funny so ima say look honey i thought i said that before but like i said again youre nothing but a big so when mike catch on the bass line thats okay cause we will not just waste time ill get straight to the point black girls are thats why ima tell ya you
better pull up your britches cause all that cash is making your ass drag from the boyfriend ya ganked and thats pretty bad i mean thats pretty sad when ya dating a black guy and then you turn around and another big black guy now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking but thats okay because you need a goddamn spanking from me the funky eminem im busting rhymes and im swallowing phlegm im busting a freestyle just like this i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed but when howard gets pissed thats okay because he leaves and he
doesnt show up for two more days so ill just worry about that problem when i come to it i cross that bridge when i come to it because i forgot the chorus but thats okay cause yall saying bust a rhyme for us so ima bust another rhyme about this black girl she turned out to be a wack girl a wack girl because black girls aint funny all they want is your godamn money they take you for everything you got and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand so ima kick it to
you just like this how does the chorus go i forgot but thats okay cause ima tell you in stride ima say oh foolish pride oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh date a white girl cause they got the raw hide i done figured this rap out i map out strategically timing is everything and that seems to be the key to my success

or give up spit on on stepped on but kept goin im tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause youre moving onto the next but is the respect gone cause someone told me that kings never die dont give me that sob story liar dont preach to the choir you aint never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me in life not even a flyer wouldnt even take into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on
these features and try to show out on a track with me but itd actually have to be a blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know has changed in this age a twitter page did it just say ive been upstaged why am i online its driving me crazy im ridin shotgun tryna get a gauge on whats hot but im not one to conform but as days pass in this and opinions sway i can hear em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as

medallion became a millionaire went downhill from there became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career the am i gon na do until then this job is too fulfilling two gajillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in and a mood to kill till i plow my coupe de ville into some children at the food pavilion and buildabear warriors mind i m prohydrocodone euphoria in the drug emporium line im soaring im pouring vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on em fore i go four
wheeler riding gory and violent and horrifying you surely wont find no one more appalling than i am with this retaliatorial rhyming for gloria steinem but i finger her like a witness show me a lineup i usually am abusive but excuse me maam i guess i mustve threw you for a loop like toucan sam when i said i could use the sample cause yous a tramp but look how you react to this trigger like when i call you a bigger than the hoover dam youre playing right in lex luthors hand its such a ruthless plan might
even lose a fan but it superman wouldnt change in a phone booth for stan im a brand new being like grand pubas band happy as anderson cooper having a tuba crammed in his pooper with lubricantwait thats too i cant since honesty is the best policy ill give you the old college try try to acknowledge my mistakes probably wont qualify as a gentleman and a scholar but its time that i swallow pride and say that im sorry sorry i cant apologize i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines and thought of rhymes that
sodomized your daughters minds then im like dollar signs but i may fight for gay rights especially if they is more of a knockout than janay rice play nice ill punch lana del rey right in the face twice like ray rice in broad daylight in plain sight of the elevator surveillance til her head is banged on the railing then celebrate with the ravens never date an assailant who selfmedicates with inhalants id meditate but i may need a better way to escape the aggression rage and the anger cause they restraints on the ankles heavyweights and an anchor
with handcuffs in chains this aint enough to contain it but i still get the same respect as jay if i came on stage in a neglig e everyday and liz claiborne devastated from breakup with kate hudson wait your friends what are they gon na say cause makeup aint gon na cover that eye thats seveneighths of the way shut peppersprayed with your face cut made my bank like a lay up off these effing skanks on the way up oh thinks shes heavensent its evident that she aint never been with seven inches yes i said seven i
measured it seven inches from the floor while im standing on the fourth floor balcony at the sheradon when im stretching it im a pimp so a limp is all youll ever get so if shes hesitant to get the hint ill bet you that i get the message sent who shes messing with hella quick when i tell a chick not to ever use as a weapon when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench existential detriments to a lesbian devil in the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level that separatists like a chechnian
rebel impressionist with a pencil a pessimist with his lips pressed against the edge of this red bull pedal to the metal im rippin this cause right away ill give it to a like a pedestrian deadly as ever you see what kind of effects she has on the opposite when i push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass shadyxv as perplexing as the last fifteen years and im predicting my next relapse when i spit these lyrics so dont look at me weird when i start shifting gears and resmears all over britney spears and
these little disney queers who use chicks for beards just made that up too oh and the shady we wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the super bowls cause its supposed to confuse you hoes the flows lose you as usual so juvenile year old when i go to the studio its only music but dont be foolish though you dont know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though in my homies buick been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it when i step
in the vocal booth like im supposed to do and i murder you on a track like tony stewart in one take if i up and i dont redo it you couldnt sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it the day i dont say you wall you can throw me through it rootinesttootinest shootin this from the hip with the sentiments eminem isnt penning them for the women im an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot but they consider me equivalent to chlamydia they tryna get rid of me gadzooks but i
stiggity stand for the fliggity flag of the united states and the freedom i distribute these raps through and if i catch you doing anything hindering or prohibiting that after i give me that tattoo of your lips on my ass imma be literally pickin up and deliberately whippin the statue of liberty at you wooooh it got it somewhere in there probably psst hey listen lalalalala i love my job whoo makes me feel like superman can you fly i can wan na see im only entertaining you my goal is to stimulate making you high and take you
and i to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly i dont mean nobody harm im just partying im not your dad not your mom not your guardian just a man whos on the mic so let me entertain you my lyrical content is constantly under fire no wonder why i constantly bomb back to combat attacks with constant concepts when lyrics are constantly took outta context failure to communicate with congress has been a problem for the longest i guess but maybe one day we can make some progress food for thought see how long
it takes to digest feeling good when i should be ashamed sht i really shouldve fell but i stood see i came like a flame in the night like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light theres a hope theres a spark but when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye until they decide to set their differences aside and this is why only one of us will survive so children follow my lead and feel the vibe cause my music can be slightly amusing you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment its stupid aint it i get sick of trying to explain it see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone tell em to get fuked and just mosie on constantly moving constantly using the constitution as a form of restitution bless the children nothing less than brilliant let me entertain you like robbie williams ill be here when yall are gone rebuilding world revolving still evolving still slim how many kidsll
copy probably millions but ima do this as a fuking hobby till then cause my lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fuked up young kids at an alarming rate common denominate add it up and youll see just why i dominate i try to stimulate but kids emulate and mimmick every move you make slim you great but wait cant you see im only here to entertain i got ta be the one to go against the grain cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane for me to see you be
influenced but pretend you aint but they dont understand that ive been through pain if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain but you cant just stand there and try to judge it hurts but youre jealousy probably tears you up inside as much and its such a pleasure every button that i touch i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but slim hi my name is you make me hurl they call me superman leap tall hoes in a single bound im single now got no ring on this finger now
