place it on his head as soon as he grabs it poof boom paow its like magic with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates and falls to the earth from which it came its done aint gon na be no more kings be wary of any man that claims because deep down he clings onto the need for power the reality hes a coward ultimately hes scared to die and sometimes so am i but when im in tune with the most high i realize the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side today

plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack and my daughter got ta eat her mama be stressing me like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet like i aint out in the field like that i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless screaming the law my life is lawless thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven this is hell and i
dont mean that hyperbolic i try to find employment even if its wiping toilets but these felonies be making life the hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it for your eyes let her know my life is on it for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes
do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes youre probably grown now so this songll hit you if youre hearing this unfortunately means that im no longer with you in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive he got me praying that the spiritual is real so i can be a part of you still
my pops was killed too so i know how part of you feels maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me life goes in cycles maybe youll date a just like me i hope not im tired of dope spots and fiends that smoke rocks ive seen far too many hopes rot im writing this because me and the devil had a dance now i see death around the corner apologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once
my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could
think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now i fear its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for
your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me its several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young blasting frustrated cause the cash running out dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the i learned in the streets was
true that real dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you
come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gon na lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for
your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions
i know you tried to steer me way from that but that was in my blood you know my life i know your mama send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like what you talking bout is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side
i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready and so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison
when he needed education sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better although i know that means i would never be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with lil zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told girl your daddy was a real not cause he was cold not because he was the first to get some twelve years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues
not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving os nah your daddy was a real not cos he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed the law although that was true your daddy was a real cause he loved you for your eyes only and im in denial and it dont take no xray to see right through my smile i know id be on the go and it aint no drink out there that can numb my soul no no all we want to

hypocrisy oh let me count the ways they came here seeking freedom and they end up owning slaves justified it using what christianity would say religion dont mean theres too much ego in the way thats why isis is in crisis but in reality this country do the same take a life and call it righteous remember when bin laden got killed supposedly in a hotel lobby after a show was noticing these white ladies watching cnn covering the action they read the headline and then they all started clapping as if lebron has just scored a basket at the
buzzer i stood there for a second watch them high five each other for real i though this was thou shalt not kill but police still letting off in the ville claiming that he reached for a gun they really think we dumb and got a death wish now somebodys son is laying breathless when i was a little boy my father lived in texas pulled up in toyota drove that like it was lexus put my bag in his trunk and headed off for dallas out their for the summer feeling just like i was alice lost in the
wonder land where still suffering just like they was back home and thats wrong so now its the government they see my struggling and they dont give a at all and thats wrong yeah the type of that make you wan na the type of that make you wan na let go the type of that make you wan na the type of that make you wan na let go i had a convo with the president i paid to go and see him thinking bout the things i said id say when i would see him feeling nervous sitting
in a room full of white folks thinking about the black man plight think i might choke nope raised my hand and asked a man a question does he see the struggles of his brother in oppression and if so if you got all the power in the clout as the president whats keeping you from helping out well i didnt say but you catch my drift he look me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift he broke the issues down and showed me he was well aware i got the vibe he was sincere and
that the brother cared but dawg you in the chair whats the hold up he said theres things that i wan na fix but you know this politics dont stop fighting and dont stop believing you can make the world better for your kids before you leave it change is slow always has been always will be but that im a bust back till they kill me change is slow always has been always will be but that im a bust back until they kill me you feel me the type of that make you wan na aight third verse

throw oppressors see if we destroy the system that means well have less of greed but see its not that simple i got to thinking bout the history of human nature while this instrumental play then i realized something that made me wonder if revolution was really ever the way before you trip and throw a fit over these words i say think about this for second you heard the way the children in abusive households grow up knocking girlfriends out cold thats called a cycle abused becomes the abuser and that how life go so understand look at the
power but you know what power does to man corruption always leads us to the same again so when you talk about revolution dawg i hear just what you saying what good is taking over when we know what you gon do the only real revolution happens right inside of you i said what good is taking over when we know what you gon do the only real revolution happens right inside of you the type of that make you wan na high for hours the type of that make you wan na let go volume one the type of
that make you wan na the type of that make you wan na let go yea i m a fool hundred thousand for the jewels last year we killed the game and left y all browsing for the clues old out here search for that fountain of the youth money talks and hoes say its an arousing point of view don t make me act a fool like malcom before the suit how could you justify i testified up in this booth and then throughout the years spilled tears and shared truths somehow they love a better when he talk
