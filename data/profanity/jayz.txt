was so turned on that she had to shower twice how ironic it would be some fight that turned into a homicide thatll alter their life see mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene had a son fifteen that he never saw twice sure he saw him as an infant but he dissed on him like if that was my son he would look much different see im lightskinned and that baby theres dark so its mommas baby poppas maybe mike was still crazy out there running the streets want had his old reliable with thirtyeight gun in his
reach its been fourteen years him and isis aint speak he running around like lifes a peach til one day he approached this thug that had a mean mug and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge you instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused hold up there was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before its like lookin in the mirror seeing hisself more mature and he took it as a
sign from the almighty lord you know what they say about he who hesitates in war whats that he who hesitates is lost he cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank the old man didnt think he just followed his instinct six shots into his kid out of the gun be a father youre killing your son six shots into his kid out of the gun be a father you killing your sons meet the parents please believe that some how some way we got ta make it up out the hood some day some how some
