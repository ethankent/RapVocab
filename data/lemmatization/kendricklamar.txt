to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word wa respect just because you wore a different gang colour than mine doesnt mean i cant respect you a a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these street if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing u but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga shit and thats all i wrote i wa gon na call another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like it something you probably
could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground represent the ground is gon na open up and swallow the evil thats how i see it my word is bond i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gon na open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gon na
be so fat they gon na be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetising the poor gon na be so poor and hungry you know what im saying it gon na be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself a somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunity i see myself a a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunity i worked
at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that work my management company i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five year you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made million for a lot of people now it time to make million for myself you know what im saying i made million for the record company i made million for these movie company now i make million

through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance it been met with resistance and not only me but it go down my family tree you know what im saying it in my vein to fight back aight well how long you think it take before nigga be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wan na lay it all down in this country a black man
only have like year we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wan na lift weight while you still wan na shoot back cause once you turn it like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wan na fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth year old muthafuckas thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you
left behind i can truly tell you that there nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today shit i think that nigga is tireda grabbin shit out the store and next time it a riot there gon na be bloodshed for real i dont think america can know that i think american think we wa just playing and it gon na be some more playing but it aint gon na be no playing it gon na be murder you know what im saying it gon
