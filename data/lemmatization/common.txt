bloodline is one with the divine in time brotha you will discover the light some say that god is black and the devil white well the devil is wrong and god is whats right i fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear the rain aint gone but i can still see clear a a child given religion with no answer to why just told believe in jesus cuz for me he did die curiosity killed the catechism understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that i played to and became a slave to master self a rich man
is one with knowledge happiness and his health my mind had dealt with the book of zen tao the lesson koran and the bible to me they all vital and got truth within em got ta read them boy you just cant skim em different branch of belief but one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em and use religion a an emblem when it should be a natural way of life who am i or they to say to whom you pray aint right thats who got you doin right and got you
this far whether you say in jesus name or hum do allah long a you know it a bein thats supreme to you you let that show towards others in the thing you do cuz when the trumpet blowin elder surround the throne only gon get home only gon get home only gon get it baby chorus ceelo ive lived and ive learned i have taken and ive earned i have laughed ive cried i have failed and i have tried sunshine pouring rain found joy through all my pain i just wan na be happy with being me ceelo
let me voice my concern so many of my fellow brother have given themselves a title that their action didnt earn our ignorance is in the same breath a our innocence subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince ive finally come to the realization why black people in the worse place cuz it hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place so i try to find the clue in you but evidently white folk know more black history than we do whyre we bein lied to i aint know our history
wa purposely hidden damn somethin in me wan na know who i am so i began my search my journey started in church it gave my heartache relief when i started to understand belief hustlin wa like a gift spent my share of time in the street taught me survival from this evil im just gon na have to deal with and i felt like a fool when i tried to learn it in school it almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal takin elder advice read the bible the koran searched scroll from
the hebrew israelite hold on this aint right jesus wasnt white some lead were granted with insight and it all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand he still created with the imperfection of man so with followin i disagree by no mean have i forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but i do know the devil aint no white man the devil a spiritual mind thats color blind there evil white folk and evil nigga you gon surely find there no positivity without negativity but one side you gon na have to choose
any chance to speak i refuse to misuse so how can you call yourself god when you let a worldly possession become an obsession and the way you write your rhyme and cant follow your lesson if a seed sown you make sure it known you make sure it grown if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own well ive lived and ive learned ive taken and ive earned i have laughed
i have cried i failed and i have tried sunshine pourin rain i found joy through my pain just wan na be happybein me bein me this the city of chicago the state of confusion this style im using is free or prolly it would be if my mind wa peep im behind cause i didnt handle my function while in high school although i wa cool the hood i live in aint that proper cause a cop a stop ya and have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty im not filthy nor am
