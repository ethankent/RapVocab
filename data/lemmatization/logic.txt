okay so what do you think life wa like before the fall i mean weve seen picture of open land a far a the eye can see and ocean incomprehensible in size that our grandparent would do their best to describe it i just cant imagine life anywhere but inside a space station i mean the simple concept of a sky doesnt even fully register we do have field on the babel station and also yeah yeah but thats all synthetic i mean were heading to this planet right that we call paradise because we hope it can sustain life
why because well eventually run out of resource exactly i mean what if we got there and it exactly a the data predicted beautiful lush then we destroy it just like we did earth there only million human being left in the universe i mean it weird to think about the fact that in the last footprint wa left on earth before ascending to babel man whats your point the point is ship have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this damn near all of them return without any luck some of them didnt return at all
i guess my fear isnt that we wont find paradise it that well create purgatory now this that spottieottiedopaliscious hella vicious i wonder where is this hold up get the fuck out my business show enough we roll up then load up just a bastard born in a wedlock close to the earth like a dreadlock got my site on deadlock vision of my enemy in a headlock feel like im livin in bedrock surrounded by rubble just a youngin in trouble took a shot and then made it a double took a shot and then made it a double

grew up honestly a musician what i know man crazy right nah whats crazy is original music hasnt been created since earth i know man lucidity what back then people had dream and achieved them in a state of total consciousness shit we took for granted wa obvious water food supply it insane to think everyday life for everyone in babel is the quest for paradise i guess thats what im looking for what being able to make music not just that if the law are abolished following the migration were free dude were not slave thomas we arent you
cant do anything outside the cause not really thats why we watch the same movie and listen to the same music i mean dont get me wrong the catalogue is incredible but we need i dont know something more yeah somethin more get em living life on the east coast way back in the day trying to beat most anybody that wan na do what i do well let me keep it one hunna with you it ain t about that ain t about hip hop ain t about rap think a minute hold up use your cap chicago know
i mma snap got ta say no basic rapping so they wonder who am i so high i said they wonder who am i so high back again never outside so i m acting in i laugh again when they don t understand what i mean bias everybody seen by u everybody wan na live a life like this man fuck that do what s good for your family make music like there s no grammy for that last line they might ban me i don t give a fuck though cause i am me from beijing to miami i
mma just do what i do with my crew ain t no telling what i m finna do but i promise that i mma keep writing for you and i know what to do everything right here for you only for you depending on what you gon na do it s all for you it s all for you who am i so high i said they wonder who am i so high let me take the time to find the rhyme and let you know that i m the only one to find the one the time is done
beyond the sky beyond the sun there is no one besides the only one and you know i got ta let em know if you love it let it go at an all time low and all i know is all i know i do what i love came from below when there wa no one above created a world no one ha been to everything that i m into everything that i ve been through bring it back like let it shine like a bad light reminisce ain t know that night got ta take flight everybody probably wonder

and uhm forget the money if you say that getting the money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time you ll be doing thing you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing thing you don t like doing which is stupid it is absolutely stupid better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way and after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter
what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others will but it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing thing you don t like and to teach our child to follow in the same track see what we are doing is we re bringing up child and educating to live the same sort of life we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their child to bring up their child to do the same thing so it s all retch
and no vomit it never get there therefore it s so important to consider this question what do i desire the incredible true story and transformation of the man who saved the world surface contact in meter meter meter time of day is constant meridian foot oxygen temperature is degree celsius man what are the chance that there s some big as creature out there that s going to eat u fuck clear sky kai which tarantino film do you think logic liked best i would definitely have to probably have to say kill bill foot man stylistically he s

strip i dont think so i sat with a jew to learn he told me thats it not meant to go to israel until the prophet return i said is this true he told me go and read the torah cause if it true then theyre following another order how can a nation that know what it like to be slaughtered go and do the same to someone else im just a spectator looking in but i can tell you how i think thing shouldve been a couple reason why the world where it is today please listen to my
word what i have to say i dont know everything and never will i claim to know what our purpose is and what we really need to grow but i do know were dying for a common cause a global word that is well known war ive been to africa and seen a grown man on the floor disabled to the point i couldnt look anymore a real beggar in a real state of poverty but he prays everyday so he know that there got ta be another life where he can live a a strong man and the ownership
of africa doesnt end up in the wrong hand western palm buying and destroying people just to trade arm could someone tell me why africa is just surviving the whole land wa a resource plus they got diamond used to be able to run your hand through the sand and get a handful of diamond do you understand how precious is the land if it like that you see it wrong to say it wa taken by the white man it wa taken by the power hungry and the people that never saw the beauty of africa fam they only
saw the money to them it wa the land of opportunity it terrorism when it done by either you or me treat these word like my eulogy and remember that i died being exactly what i choose to be inshaallah we all can see that god is the goodness in you and me no religion ha ownership see the quran and the bible and the torah were all wrote with ink see i think the mass are miseducated see most of the politician were born racist see it obvious that somehow were all related million of year back before we
separated i heard tony benn say it in a speech see how can you murder another brother because he weak your ancestor could have been cousin so take a seat and try and reason with your brother fam before you beef im just a spectator looking in from my view im not different or special im just like you bleed blood and shed tear when my heart hurting i get energy from everything in life im learning how to say my thought release my stress through my word make you visualise everything youve ever heard picture ancient egyptian meditating to
the element telepathically debating until the pirate came in the form of tradesman promised them a paradise in exchange for a heaven temptation and misinterpretation so they jeopardise the whole of the nation you see a paradise is where we might choose to go but a heaven is the place where the angel go so they can reason with the prophet not bathe in gold and it not late for no one to save your soul im a citizen of truth love and loyalty every person on the planet is royalty these are my thought how i look at thing
