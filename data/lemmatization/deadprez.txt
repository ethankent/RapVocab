his whole life wa maintained off the everyday labor from the mule in the field to the cattle in the stable this is how we kept food on this table maxing you would have he wa disabled by the way he be relaxing acting like mr magnificent but the animal were thinking something different the sentiment wa tension in the barnyard throughout the year they had been through mad drama with the farmer word is bond and they all came to one conclusion they argued there wa no way theyd ever be free if it wa up to human therefore
the only course left wa revolution which wa understandable and since the pig promised to lead in the interest of all the animal they planned a full attack under the leadership of hannibal the fattest pig in the pack the next morning on the farm everything wa calm just before dawn but before long the sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric now check it this is when that shit got hectic directed by hannibal the animal attacked old sam wa in a state of shock and fell up on his back and dropped his rifle reaching
in vain each and every creature from the field at his throat screaming kill feel the pain this is the animal in man this is the animal in you this is the animal in man coming true after they ran the farmer off the farm the pig went around and called a meeting in the barn hannibal spoke for several hour but when talk about his plan for power thats when the conversation turned sour he issued an offical ordinance to set if not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate thats when the horse went buckwild one
of them shouted out you fraudulent pig we know your fucking style hannibal face wa flushed and pale all the animal eye full of disgust and betrayal he felt the same way sam felt they took his tongue out of his mouth and cut his body up for sale for real you better listen while you can it a very thin line between animal and man when hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand what would have done shook his hand this is the animal in man remember it still bigger than hip hop hip hop hip hop
