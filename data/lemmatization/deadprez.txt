his whole life wa maintained off the everyday labor from the mule in the field to the cattle in the stable this is how we kept food on this table maxing you would have he wa disabled by the way he be relaxing acting like mr magnificent but the animal were thinking something different the sentiment wa tension in the barnyard throughout the year they had been through mad drama with the farmer word is bond and they all came to one conclusion they argued there wa no way theyd ever be free if it wa up to human therefore
the only course left wa revolution which wa understandable and since the pig promised to lead in the interest of all the animal they planned a full attack under the leadership of hannibal the fattest pig in the pack the next morning on the farm everything wa calm just before dawn but before long the sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric now check it this is when that shit got hectic directed by hannibal the animal attacked old sam wa in a state of shock and fell up on his back and dropped his rifle reaching
in vain each and every creature from the field at his throat screaming kill feel the pain this is the animal in man this is the animal in you this is the animal in man coming true after they ran the farmer off the farm the pig went around and called a meeting in the barn hannibal spoke for several hour but when talk about his plan for power thats when the conversation turned sour he issued an offical ordinance to set if not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate thats when the horse went buckwild one
of them shouted out you fraudulent pig we know your fucking style hannibal face wa flushed and pale all the animal eye full of disgust and betrayal he felt the same way sam felt they took his tongue out of his mouth and cut his body up for sale for real you better listen while you can it a very thin line between animal and man when hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand what would have done shook his hand this is the animal in man remember it still bigger than hip hop hip hop hip hop

returning to the source of serenity a courageous walk down the mississippi road we live in the blue of the delta a good morning to your neighbor a good night to your dream we are the song of survival a living song without lyric or word a kind gesture a wink of the eye a loving touch upon a child s head a strong warm hug to keep away the doubt grandma grandma s hand upon your face the wiping of the wavered tear holding back the fizz and between inbetween the shoe shine and the dish washing and between
inbetween the gd s and phd s and between inbetween the owl house and crack house we we create wave to live and love we live on the move move moving moving forward through the bling bling the prison captain the clothes castor and the hoe and bitch and the alcohol and jesus all on the same corner we are the one and true living god all around u is life our humanity our humanity is the essence of life our blood our blood nurture the soul our humiliation and pain give an expression our ignorance give vision to what
s like living contradiction living pillar doctor living phenomenon living just for the city for a smile for a touch for hiphop for the glory of our ancestor and the blessing of our guide peace are we addicted to the struggle or committed to success are we focused on the positive or holdin onto stress not sayin thing perfect but in many way im blessed learnin how to take the negative and flip for the best everyday bring challenge every challenge is a chance to advance the power is right in our own hand from a youth full of rage
to a wise grown man here i am life is beautiful now i overstand im lookin forward through my rearview mirror in hindsight got ta be more than just a g if you keepin your mind right better be ready for the battle or focused on my fight i aint sittin on no sideline watchin them highlight im gon na begin the game playin to win but learnin from setback and my strength and weakness and masterin what im best at power of refinement until you get right exact it all in your mind but thats dependin where your head
at life is a chess match and lesson come from your mistake try not to end up in checkmate no matter whatever it take long a youre breathin then you can be problem solvin stayin involved evolved world keep revolvin for the cause be all you can from the mornin to the sunset you never have no regret took the journey to the edge of your fate and then lept not just understandin but overstandin is the objective keep it open in perspective just let me be what i am take my destiny in my hand by my action you
can judge where i stand and i hope one day youll overstand change come from the inside out no fear live free let the truth ride out im steady shakin off the shackle of the old me wakin up daily meditation feelin so free they hate to see you change yeah but they dont understand no the le you see for yourself you wont comprehend the caterpillar dont care what you think about him he wa born to be fly his nature gon na bring it outta him by the struggle i wa never broken i wa broken open i
tapped into a source that wa omnipotent had to shift my focus to my higher purpose aint nothing weak about broke it take a fighter courage people say they want a revolution but steady holdin on the slave idea afraid of evolution in life we live and learn it pratice theory practice wisdom is organically grown it not prepackaged it forward baby never backwards we think we found the absolute truth but only to discouver it a labyrinth we go from on maze to another so many chamber and angle peelin the onion layer within it all i see the
same gang just different player so i rebel from the prison cell of the pidgeon hole and dare to be myself original a man life on principle i dont posture to be popluar born to be a leader not just a blind follower it family before the dollar your priority in order and like bruce lee say be the water be the earth be the wind and the fire elevate take it higher it instinct fulfill your need and your desire but we go to be compassionate considerate a people advocate eradicatin ignorance through experience the more you live the
more you learn and you grow it ha a positive effect on all the people you know it motivation i hope that you will overstand look at thing without any opinion otherwise youll never look at reality look at thing without any philosophy without any prejudice without any dogma creed or scripture just look without arrogance and see the cause of ignorance it overstands change is neccessary to evolution the universe contains incredible diversity and you can not experience it all within the confines of one comfortable lifestyle look ahead to what you will think of your life at it
end you will probably not want to look back and say it wa cozy and dull thus react positively to what seems to be disaster remember that what seems how to be disaster may be an important step toward evolution and may even be identifiable a such at some point in the future every great loss take you out of a rut and start life anew be grateful for the time you had and your former happy state and look forward eagerly to the new phase information age where there s health neglect there s no selfrespect but what else
