chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beat for local act just to try to keep the light on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordan or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this hal melville sample i played it for hip over the phone he like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time like the drum
really werent soundin right to me so i went and um i wa listening to dre chronic at that time and really i just like picked the drum off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled and now it kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life and that wa like really the first beat of that kind that wa on the dynasty album i could say that wa the the resurgence of this whole sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and
at the time i wa still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hiphop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there a time in every man life where he got ta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the song
cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said check this out tell me what you think of this right here tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i wa thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it so what you thinkin and i wa like man that shit
tite you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i wa on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thing you know i got group i got act im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been one of my homeys that wa one of my artist he got signed but it wa supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company
so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude wa tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beat from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a uhaul maybe about ten day before i had to actually get out so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause he a jerk me and my mother drove to come on let just go newark new jersey i hadnt even seen my apartment i remember i pulled
up kanye baby were here i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made wa uh heart of the city and bean wa still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it wa bean birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beat and you know i could see he in the zone he already had the beat that he wanted i did nothing like already at that
time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it wa yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx no i think jay gon like this one right here and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them face like
