back follow the yellow brick road a we go on another episode journey with me a i take you through this nifty little place i once used to call home sweet home step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldier bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wage on for toy soldier im supposed to be the soldier who never blow his composure even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my
shoulder i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it even if it mean goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter id never drag them in battle that i can handle unless i absolutely have to im supposed to set an example i need to be the leader my crew look for me to guide em if some shit ever doe pop off im supposed to be beside em that ja shit i tried to squash it it wa too late to stop it there a certain line you just dont cross
and he crossed it i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it it wa crazy this shit went way beyond some jayz and na shit and even though the battle wa won i feel like we lost it i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it this aint what im in hiphop for it not why i got in it that wa never my object for someone to get killed why would i wan na destroy something
i help build it wasnt my intention my intention were good i went through my whole career without ever mentionin and that wa just out of respect for not runnin my mouth and talkin about something that i knew nothing about plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while he all over tv down talkin a man who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business but still knowin this shit
could pop off at any minute cause there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin but now it elevated cause once you put someone kid in it the shit get escalated it aint just word no more is it it a different ball game callin name and you aint just rappin we actually tried to stop the and ja beef from happenin me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him and asked him not to start it
he wasnt gon na go after him until ja started yappin in magazine how we stabbed him fuck it smash em mash em and let him have it meanwhile my attention is pullin in other direction some receptionist at the source who answer phone at his desk ha an erection for me and think that ill be his resurrection try to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record but now he fucked the game up cause one of the way i came up wa through that publication the same one that made me famous now the

blind my insight through the mind i exercise my right to express when i feel it time it just all in your mind what you interpret it a i say to fight you take it a imma whip someone as if you dont understand dont even bother to ask a father who ha grown up with a fatherless past who ha blown up now to rap phenomenon that ha or at least show no difficulty multitask and in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur who ha helped launch a few more rap act who had a few obstacle

flat one bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of mile on novara and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it and you and lainnie were too young to understand it papa wa a rollin stone momma developed a habit and it all happened too fast for either one of u to grab it im just sorry

everyones telling me what i should do and how i should come out and what to rap about and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i got ta get out and im not sure how this is gon na come off theyre probably gon na think that im coming off a cocky haha like i just started giving a fuck what you really think about me see the thing about me is you dont really know a thing about me everyones making a stink about me like there some kind of a aura of
that of the king around me surround me with nothin but gangster killer and banger and the most dangerous criminal and i feel like im more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin neighbor but see my dream is to be remembered a one of the best when i leave but why doe it seem like im not even put up in the same category a other emcee so when weezy say that he better than jayz please be that just subliminally mean he think jiggas the best and that he the only one up in that league

a threat to anyone see he just aight and bubba sparxxx he just wont write because he so caught up in that snow white that timbaland cant even get him in the studio he so gone off that coke right and it so sad cause he dope right america next great white hope right so now they feel like they got ta come up with some corny as white rapper show right and which im still havin mixed feeling about they said itd be real im just spillin it out there somethin about a white boy talking black and runnin
around with a damn grill in his mouth and i love when the say that tiger wood shit isnt it ironic that the best rapper white and the best golfer black and im the one who got ta catch all the flack offa that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parent had all got to likin me now when suddenly i wasnt such a bad guy all of the hatred for me mustve died thought i committed career suicide so i had
to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gay and anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy not raggedy andy and andy and andy and angelina jolie is just another ho and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her she want to go to somalia to adopt another baby you know what i say no you better save some of them kid from madonna she need all the publicity she can get you want a shady well you got it man i aint apologizin for shit im a goat and i dont mean to gloat

tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handle unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this you dont plan for intruder beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fan irony spectacular huh now who a faggot you punk and here your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it just
me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it were in a car right now wait here come my favorite lyric im the bad guy who make fun of people that die and hey here a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy well hows this for publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this youll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initial i initially wa gon na bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exit time is quite near i hope we dont get stopped no license i fear that siren i hear guess on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea a cop appear in my driver side mirror oh god police ah hope foxtrot get an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well got ta go almost at the bridge haha
big bro it for you slim this is for him and frank ocean hope you can swim good now say you hate homo again outro eminem i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those joke you offend im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching it end but you refuse to believe that it
over here we go all over again back to the wall i m stacking up all them odds toilet clogged yeah cause i m talking a lotta shit but i m backing it all up but in my head there s a voice in the back and it holler after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i m the ringing in your ear i m the polyp on the back of your tonsil eating your vocal chord after your concert i m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged grab for
some water but i m that pill that s too jagged to swallow i m the bully you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the doublestandards you have when it come to your daughter i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper s persona s half a fa ade and matthew and stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til it s gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fan that are calling your name camera

before you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop so one last time i m back before it fade into black and it s all over behold the final chapter in the saga trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawing tap into thought blacker and darker than anything imaginable here go a wild stab in the dark a we pick up where the last mathers left off dont kill me hurry the fuck up thank you go

in a tantrum about to explode all over the canvas back with the yoda of rap in a spasm your music usually ha them but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt follow you must rick rubin my little padawan a jedi in training colossal brain and thought of entertaining but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog cant even find the page i wa writing
this rhyme on oh it on a rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small it say ever since i drove a lincoln with white wall had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so a long a im on the clock punching this time card hip hop aint dying on my watch but sometimes when i m sleeping she come to me in my dream is she taken is she mine don t got i don t care don t have two shit to give let me take you by the

rhyme fall into the wrong hand and make you want to get up and start dancing even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping blue light flashing laughing all the way to the bank lamping in my kmart mansion i m in the style department with a pile in my cart ripping the aisle apart with great power come absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beat killing spree your honor i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who
caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hip hop is the devil music is that me it belongs to me cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horn that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rapper better stay clear of me bitch cause it the it the time of the season when hate run high and this time i wont give it to you

so much more to learn it page left to be read so put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor while i hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor word can weigh a ton therefore it never to fall into the hand of the wrong one yeah it another there are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side but i see no borderline from under this colorblind and some will probably never hold peices of the sacred but then im finally about to put an
end to the hatred the world would never endure to arguing awaking to the abscence of unity is startling oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do you can not beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to the outcome we want nothing despicable so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and youre dull it time you faced this here taste this straight from off of the pile one of the numerous style the date of my birth on the earth the

til next week now it wa next week and she wa back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she wa my girlfriend we started going out but thats okay because we were black and white black and white they sometimes mix but black girl only want your money cause theyre dumb chick so ima say like this dont date a black girl take it a a dis if you want but if you dont ima tell you like this i surely wont never date a black girl because black only want your money and that shit aint funny
so ima say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because it green and thats cash so get outta here cause i dont need your as i said that before but thats okay because like i said youre a whore black girl and white girl just dont mix because black girl are dumb and white girl are good chick white girl are good i like white girl i like white girl all over the world white girl are fine and they blow
my mind and thats why im here now telling you this rhyme cause black girl i really dont like we dont mix it like riding a bike when youre peddling hard uphill both way you know it kinda hard and thats why i say to you im giving you a little advice dont date a black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice you wont ever do it again because theyll take your money and that aint funny so ima say look honey i thought i said that before but like i said again youre nothing
but a big whore so when mike catch on the bass line thats okay cause we will not just waste time ill get straight to the point black girl are bitch thats why ima tell ya you better pull up your britches cause all that cash is making your as drag from the boyfriend ya ganked and thats pretty bad i mean thats pretty sad when ya dating a black guy and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking but thats okay because you need a goddamn spanking from

id meditate but i may need a better way to escape the aggression rage and the anger cause they restraint on the ankle heavyweight and an anchor with handcuff in chain this aint enough to contain it but i still get the same respect a jay if i came on stage in a fucking neglig e everyday and liz claiborne devastated from breakup with kate hudson wait slut your friend what are they gon na say cause makeup aint gon na cover that eye thats seveneighths of the way shut peppersprayed with your face cut made my bank like a

weapon when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench existential detriment to a lesbian devil in the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level that separatist like a chechnian rebel impressionist with a pencil a pessimist with his lip pressed against the edge of this red bull pedal to the metal im rippin this shit cause right away ill give it to a bitch like a pedestrian deadly a ever you see what kind of effect she ha on the opposite sex when i push her flexible little sexy as through a plate of plexiglas shadyxv
a perplexing a the last fifteen year and im predicting my next relapse when i spit these lyric so dont look at me weird when i start shifting gear and shit resmears all over britney spear and these little disney queer who use chick for beard just made that up too oh and the shady we wrote it in roman numeral like they do for the super bowl cause it supposed to confuse you hoe the flow lose you a usual so juvenile year old when i go to the studio it only music but dont be foolish though you
dont know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though in my homies buick been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it when i step in the vocal booth like im supposed to do and i murder you on a fuckin track like tony stewart in one take if i fuck up and i dont redo it you couldnt sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it the day i dont say fuck you wall you can throw me through it rootinesttootinest shootin this from
the hip with the sentiment eminem isnt penning them for the woman im an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot but they consider me equivalent to chlamydia they tryna get rid of me gadzooks but i stiggity stand for the fliggity flag of the united state and the freedom i distribute these rap through and if i catch you doing anything hindering or prohibiting that after i give me that tattoo of your lip on my as imma be literally pickin up and deliberately whippin the statue of liberty at you wooooh fuck it got it
somewhere in there probably psst hey listen lalalalala i love my job whoo make me feel like superman can you fly i can wan na see im only entertaining you my goal is to stimulate making you high and take you and i to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly i dont mean nobody harm im just partying im not your dad not your mom not your guardian just a man who on the mic so let me entertain you my lyrical content is constantly under fire no wonder why i constantly bomb back to
combat attack with constant concept when lyric are constantly took outta context failure to communicate with congress ha been a problem for the longest i guess but maybe one day we can make some progress food for thought see how long it take to digest feeling good when i should be ashamed sht i really shouldve fell but i stood see i came like a flame in the night like a ghost in the dark there a ray there a light there a hope there a spark but when planet collide theyll never see eye to eye until they decide
to set their difference aside and this is why only one of u will survive so child follow my lead and feel the vibe cause my music can be slightly amusing you shouldnt take lyric so serious it might be confusing just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment it stupid aint it i get sick of trying to explain it see i could sit and argue with you but it go beyond just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond cause i came here to uplift let your woe be gone tell em to get fuked and just mosie on constantly
