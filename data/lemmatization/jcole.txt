hardest resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it thats why i write this sonnet if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it for your eye let her know my life is on it for your eye for your eye only for your eye do you understand for your eye do you understand me for your eye do you understand for your eye do you

maybe you spite me life go in cycle maybe youll date a nigga just like me i hope not im tired of dope spot and fiend that smoke rock ive seen far too many nigga hope rot im writing this because me and the devil had a dance now i see death around the corner apologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dream once my eye had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight year my pop shot up drug
related mama addicted so granny raised me in project where thug wa hanging blood wa staining the concrete older nigga i loved talked like they wa above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six year later wa handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eye had ever seen i wa nineteen took me two
felony to see the trap this crooked as system set for me and now i fear it too late for me to ever be the one that set example that wa never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keep on catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand for your eye do you understand for your eye do you understand me for your eye do you understand for your eye do you understand me for your eye do you understand for your eye do you
understand me for your eye do you understand for your eye do you understand me it several way i couldve went out too many to count wa it the trigger happy cracker that the badge give clout wa it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out nigga dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga wa skewed my view misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned in the street wa true that real nigga dont speak when they beef with you they just
pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i wa a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cop ducking rule hugging block that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goal and point of view much broader than the corner if not it gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pop and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while
hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gon na lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean it true but maybe there a chance that it not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewel and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoe i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eye only for your eye for your eye only for your eye for your eye only for your eye do
you understand for your eye one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brain still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it wa chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we wa child i never asked for nothing when time wa hard i never had discussion with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussion of my action i know you tried to steer me way from that

action they read the headline and then they all started clapping a if lebron ha just scored a basket at the buzzer i stood there for a second watch them high five each other for real i though this wa thou shalt not kill but police still letting off nigga in the ville claiming that he reached for a gun they really think we dumb and got a death wish now somebody son is laying breathless when i wa a little boy my father lived in texas pulled up in toyota drove that bitch like it wa lexus put my
