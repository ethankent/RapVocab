behind it i tend to freak with this i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin and all she gave wa a decent kiss thinkin she been spoiled but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for day and come up with tin foil we could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheet and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing her reputation in jeopardy cuz it aint take her of that shopping to get her next to me collectively i look for a proper
chick thatll rep for me instead of seeing something she want and callin and textin me for thinkin that exists i got a feeling im wrong nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh love lost love gone love lost love is gone look if you a girl with the aspiration of being in the background witcha ass shakin hittin club and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so much more to my dude at the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigar at the

to me if thats not how it is it aint how it appear to be you got blind heater in my sweat is a mind reader and when the psychic get to touchin my palm seein your physical the thing that you never say to me visible especially when one of your artist feelin threatened cause im harnessin a weapon wont you pardon my reflection mirror mirror tell me why they wan na get and scrimmage to play around to perfection im the spittin image my verbal camp is vivid i told you im spittin image it seems we often
want to start but never get to finish my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova and writing college rhyme but the thrill is over let me assist you like a specialist so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphor and the rest of this it not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist which mean if shit go bad i say i expected this and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate instead of understanding it a tune of hate the city mine like oklahoma a sooner state
and were gon na have to cross path whether soon or late so why dont you walk up in the spot using le strut you aint morris chestnut you lighter and le cut and let be honest by now you should be your own scholar you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler you got rapper being repetitive actor you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boi southern smoke yeah ren mof haha it drake man it drake manyeah ayo ren this that gritty shit here man ima half to tell them about i
been through on this know what i mean ho southern smoke very few give you that truth it either they cant do it with lyric or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing the sample that they using cant get through the clearing ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it my father early careering forced my parent to split up my mother wa a teacher my father wa kind of fed up with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus and he got back into doing what he wa doing
before u because money is an issue your son he gon miss you and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too now you looking for ex you aint never expect this you end up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis nobody passing judgment or question where the drug went you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt and mommy ima support her i keep it all in order see her with tear in her eye or you arrested at the border but i got stress on
my shoulder trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullet trying to get older and you wonder why we turn to drug and chain smoker it stress my nigga im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool
question what i been through i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you picture when i wa in school me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i wa into rest of the kid were sheltered i never liked to fight but when someone called me a nigger id punch them i couldnt help it now im grown i can say what it is it parent that got these black and filipino nanny raising they kid and your daddy want it very right i make you happy plus im jewish he
dont approve i think he want you to marry white he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white because black is black honey even if he very light and so i never been for dinner at they place always brutally honest and so i pin it to they face i live it so the case is whether drake is way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist i got stress on my shoulder trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullet trying to get older and you
wonder why we turn to drug and chain smoker it stress my nigga im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo am i hot a the rest should i strive for my spot a the best like girl with double d i got ta lot on my chest there question that need to be answered thats not on the test
instead of staring at quiz now it model with breast and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician homie i probably could of been on tv consistent an artist like pablo or maybe peteys assistant and my mindset is come and get me im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson nigga get the handgun if not you gon make me
call the burbs out in richmond that have you nigga laying out on the curb they some hitman last couple of month i done probably been around the world and back and i dont wan na question half the place nick been i got stress on my shoulder uh trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder yeah young black man dodge your bullet trying to get older oh and you wonder why we turn to drug and chain smoker yeah man it stress my nigga im just trying to live my life cuz make
a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this that gritty shit boy im just trying to live my life cuz got me winded over here man make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo uh sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only one with enough to feel what im about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling it
wrong that there is when all the press article happening and the camera get to snapping and they try to make you out a a lie symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason it a lose lose why even try when your idea so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone call is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethic and the motif to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the
perk and nigga wan na say that you aint around i mean there always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town you gon na try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry and the manager make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher than most of these rapper running the game concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash there time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range
also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneaker and watched the game from the bleacher because im really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time i wasted late out at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winner so this album is a labor of love you say a long a im staying out of the
street and just spending money on beat that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv thats exactly why i often get burned but im gon na try to you gon na try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry uh what up yall soundtrack whats popping baby yall aint know i go by the name of lupe fiasco representing that first and fifteen jyea uh and this one right here i dedicate this one right here to all my homies out there
grinding you know what im saying legally and illegally hahaha you know what im talking about so check it out first got it when he wa six didnt know any trick matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped landed on his hip and bust his lip for a week he had to talk with a lisp like thisssss now we can end the story right here but shorty didnt quit there wa something in the air yea he said it wa something so appealing he couldnt fight the feeling something about it he knew he couldnt
doubt it couldnt understand it brand it just the first kickflip he land it uh labeled a misfit a bandit kakunk kakunk kakunk his neighbor couldnt stand it so he wa banished to the park started in the morning wouldnt stop til after dark yea when they said it getting late in here so im sorry young man there no skating here and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast and away he rolled just a rebel to the world with no place to go and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push
coast so come and skate with me just a rebel looking for a place to be so let kick and push and coast waddup lupe chi town my style is very tennessee mixed with some terry kennedy people barley remember me from back in the day i done got some contact and threw the glass away the time it took me to get cool wa a massive delay but check it get boring growing up in memphis trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice mama probably would have done anything to prevent this cause every single time
i break a board it get expensive luckly my aunt working a a nurse so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse and plus shed always give me speech on the first if i m staying in her house then i need to get some work i tell her i wa there on vacation she say you need to be doing something other than skating why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement i ma let him know that your coming honey he waiting so now it me and old school

again think it obvious that they need my soul cousin at the door like ri mi fa so i say aunty this is a safe career she said drake i told you there no skating here and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast and away he rolled just a rebel to the world with no place to go and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast so come and skate with me just a rebel looking for a place to be so let kick and push and coast before he knew
he had a crew that wasnt no punk and they spitfire shirt and sb dunk they would push til they couldnt skate no more office building lobby wasnt safe no more and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more just the freedom wa better than breathing they said any escape route they used to escape out when thing got crazy they needed to break out they head to any place with stair any good grind the world wa theirs uh and their four wheel would take them there until the cop came and said there no skating here
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast and away he rolled just a rebel to the world with no place to go and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast so come and skate with me just a rebel looking for a place to be so let kick and push and coast shake up the world that is what i am bout to do and homie you aint even on my altitude im tellin you i got enough cloud for two and like a nxgga turn blood i came out the

know what to make of it hate is so familiar to me i m slowly embracing it doesn t come natural bear with me it could take a bit yeah and my dream are who i m racing with and you can see i m pacing it so that i m always chasing it wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with i hope that my success never alters our relationship yeah this life is something i would die for october own but it looking like july i just wish they d let you try it
first this time i m really going off firework today it begin i missed them before but wont miss them again i keep having the same dream and i think that i just realized what it mean all i see is firework all i see is firework every night it firework every night it firework all i see is firework all i see is firework taking off like firework taking off like firework i m just such a gentleman you should give it up for me look at how i m placing all my napkin and my cutlery i could
tell it wasn t love i just thought you fuck with me who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me damn i kept my wit about me luckily what happened between u that night it always seems to trouble me now all of a sudden these gossip brag wan na cover me and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me but i wa curious and i ll never forget it baby what an experience you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious their wa smoke in the air before that
wa me clearing it that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though you never see it coming you just get to see it go yeah i shouldve looked up in the sky at first now i can see it in her eye firework everything the same but it feel different my dad called me up knowing that i still listen and he s still got his foot out guilt trippin it s been year though i just learn to deal with it for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport got
