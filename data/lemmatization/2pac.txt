can take there only so much someone can swallow and tolerate to the point that he just break snap and thats all it take youd think that we wa learning from other rapper mistake but we aint it plain to go against with every artist come the image he portrays and a picture that he paint but in the midst of all this anger and this angst never once did you hear me say im a gangster and i aint hear no complaint but i know that i will always continue to grow a long a i lead and never
follow no one el shadow there will never be another me and that i can guarantee thats why the fuck i remain sucker free to this day the game will never be the same no matter how much fame or success they attain there will never be another me and no matter what they do there will never be another you you can search but youll never find you can try to rewind time but in your heart and your mind we will never die we are forever alive and we continue growing one day at a time dont be
caught in the publicity and caught in the hype rapper are regular people minus money and light searching for fortune and fame and super stardom all the jewelry all the car whose crew is the hardest now the hiphop police the villain is watching and kid think beef is the only option outlaw born filthy guilty a charged my memory of khaddafi but makaveli life on you think the industry is fun and no pity with gun and when your money is up thats when your enemy come so if he died and came back would he try to save
rap we needing a change the drama remains i spent my whole life fighting myself that i cant win so im inviting some help and every now and then i take right from left im still just like a kid looking for stripe on my belt and that there is a fight in itself so i just pray and hope god take a like to myself no matter how much i try stay alive im gunna die mad still standing there in love with my pride heard frivolous beat we past that im trying to keep some income coming in
