  Ayo This song is dedicated to all the happy people All the happy people who have real nice lives And have no idea what its like to be broke as fuck   I feel like Im walking a tight rope without a circus net Im popping percocets Im a nervous wreck I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged Full of venom and rage Especially when Im engaged And my daughters down to her last diaper Thats got my ass hyper I pray that god answers maybe Ill ask nicer Watching ballers while theyre flossing in their pathfinders These overnight stars becoming autograph signers We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us Along with the small frys and average half pinters While player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us Moneyll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless While snakes slither in the grass spineless   Thats Rock Bottom When this life makes youre mad enough to kill Thats Rock Bottom When you want something bad enough to steal Thats Rock Bottom When you feel like youve had it up to here Cause youre mad enough to scream but youre sad enough to tear   My life is full of empty promises And broken dreams Im hoping things will look up But there aint no job openings I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished Living in this house with no furnace unfurnished And Im sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay And Im tired of being hired and fired the same day But fuck it if you know the rules to the game play Cause when we die we know were all going the same way Its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan When all you need is bucks to be the man Plus a luxury sedan Too comfortable and roomy in a six But they threw me in the mix With all these gloomy lunatics Who walk around depressed And smoke a pound of ses a day And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today My daughter wants to throw the ball but Im too stressed to play Live half my life and throw the rest away    Theres people that love me and people that hate me yup But its the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady I want the money the women the fortune and the fame That means Ill end up burning in hell scorching in flames That means Im stealing your checkbook and forging your name Theres lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain Cause right now I feel like Ive just hit the rock bottom I got problems now everybody on my blocks got em Im done Im screaming like those two cops when pac shot em Holding two glocks I hope your doors got new locks on em My daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em And the rings youre wearing look like they got a few rocks on em And while you flaunt em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want em Cause I never went gold off one song Im running up on someones lawn with guns drawn

brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog Drag em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks AHH And even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge til one night Mrs Stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a Dr He grabbed Stace by the legs as chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander they never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you So see

   These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing its so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care Hes a problem child What bothers him all comes out when he talks about His fuckin dad walkin out Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out His thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants dorags and a stocking cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose His house is a broken home theres no control he just lets his emotions go   Cmon sing with me sing sing for the years Sing it sing for the laughter sing for the tears cmon Sing it with me just for today maybe tomorrow the good Lordll take you away   Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy only have one homie Only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate Its like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin on corners and porches just rappin To havin a fortune no more kissin ass But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all they kids be listenin to me religiously so Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense Pete Its all political if my music is literal and Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you     They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you  and cock it too Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols And they want to get one cause they think the shits cool Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers Of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus But music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our cheques in the mail Its fucked up aint it How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted Thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in their lives Till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in their eyes Thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe theyll admit it when were gone Just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

  Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey what daddy always tell you Straighten up little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about You got me  Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad When Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry Cause youre scared I aint there Daddys with you in your prayers No more crying wipe them tears Daddys here no more nightmares We gon pull together through it we gon do it Lainie Uncles crazy aint he Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it Were all we got in this world When it spins when it swirls When it whirls when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusing you Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as daddy that he had to see Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I dont see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream   Now hush little baby dont you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya Daddys here to hold ya through the night I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy pretty baby But I promise mamas gon be alright  Ha Its funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me Cause daddy couldnt buy em Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mammas heart And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara And thats when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the TV and momma didnt like it And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now Im sitting in this empty house just reminiscing Lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now Wow I guess you pretty much are and daddys still here Lainnie Im talkin to you too daddys still here I like the sound of that yeah Its got a ring to it dont it Shh mamas only gone for the moment    And if you ask me to Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird Imma give you the world Imma buy a diamond ring for you Imma sing for you Ill do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine Imma break that birdies neck Ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad ha ha

  Verse    Eminem It s like Im in this dirt digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you it won t work All it takes is one song on the radio you re right back on it Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off And left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well looks like I hit a growth spurt But I am coming for closure Don t suppose an explanation I m owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh you thought it was over You could just close the chapter And go about your life like it was nothing You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine Well I ve never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha bout to go through s tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can t think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset  Hook   Sarah Jaffe I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth But its easier to justify Whats bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy  Verse    Eminem And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch To think it was you at one time I worshipped shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew sic knit wit Thought some time had past and Id forget it forget it You left our family in shambles You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed May be gone but hes not forgotten And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long That Ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya Youre wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him same shit you did to me cold Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through Feelings I harbor all this pentup resentment I hold on to Not once you call to ask me how Im doing Letters you dont respond to em Fuck it Im coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you The cause of my problems My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on you Poof then Im gone voosh And    Verse    Eminem Ive been driving around your side of this town Like  frickin hours and  minutes now Finally I found your new address park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And its now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva My knife is out and Im ducking on the side of your house See its sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But I aint here for ya empathy I dont need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential I peeked Continue to peep still bent low Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo Sneak all the way round to the back porch Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this You dont plan for intruders beforehand Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung Stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk By one of your fans ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it were in a car right now Wait here comes my favorite lyric Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy Well hows this for publicity stunt This should be fun Last album now cause after this youll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell bitch I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits time is quite near I hope we dont get stopped no license I fear That sirens I hear Guess  on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea As cops appear in my drivers side mirror Oh God police Ah Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least New plan Stan Slim chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln town car Well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you Slim this is for him and Frank Ocean hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again  Outro   Eminem I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend Im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in Im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope its hopeless Im the denial that youre hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again Backs to the wall I m stacking up all them odds toilets clogged Yeah  cause I m talking a lotta shit but I m backing it all up But in my head there s a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished I am your lack of a conscience I m the ringing in your ears I m the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts I m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged Grab for some water but I m that pill that s too jagged to swallow I m the bullies you hate that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper s persona s half a fa ade and Matthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til it s gone Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them Im the hindsight to say  I told you so Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don t stop after they call you Biggest laughing stock of rap who can t call it quits When it s time to walk away I m every guilt trip the baggage you have But as you gather up all your possessions If theres anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact then dont bother So before you rest your case Better make sure youre packing a wallop So one last time I m back Before it fades into black and it s all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up where the last Mathers  left off 
   Dont kill me   Hurry the fuck up  Thank you  Go go go what the f uck What the fuck are you doing Mothafucker bail on me Fuck you  Aw you gotta be fucking kidding me Are you fucking kidding me Shit Get off  Haha  The parking lot Shit ah   Let me see your hands pranks over   Fuck it

front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys Still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and Heres what they want from me Theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it Lifes handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then Dont mistake him for Satan Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king Think not Why be a king when you can be a God

   I can feel the heat rising everything is on fire Today is a painful reminder of why We can only get brighter The further you put it behind ya But right now Im on the inside Lookin out cause   Im standin in the flames Its a beautiful kind of pain Settin fire to yesterday Find the light find the light find the light   Yesterday was the tornado warning Todays like the morning after Your world is torn in half You wake in its wake to start the mourning process And rebuilding youre still a work in progress Todays a whole new chapter Its like an enormous asthma Thunderstorm has passed ya You weathered it and poked its eye out With the thorn bush that you Used to smell the roses Stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed So focused on the bright side Then you floor the gas pedal And hit the corner fast the more asserted Never looking back May hit the curb But every day is a new learning curve as you Steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve But you have to To avert a disaster Lucky no permanent damage Cause they hurt you so bad Its like they murdered your ass And threw dirt on your casket but youve returned from the ashes And that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline And while youre burning the past standing in the inferno and chant     Youre so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like It happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life And its as though you feel youve died Cause youve been killed inside But yet youre still alive Which means you will survive Although today you may weep cause youre weakened And everything seems so bleak and hopeless The light that youre seekin It begins to seep in Thats the only thing keepin You from leapin off the mothafreakin deep end And Im pullin for you to push through this feeling And with a little time that should do the healing And by tomorrow You may even feel so good that youre willing to forgive em even after All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building Youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it And as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down Cause youre so over em You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling   As time passes Things change every day But wounds wounds heal but scars still remain the same But tomorrow todays going down in flames Throw the match set the past ablaze   So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire From the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief Its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell But youve extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies as you scream     I feel the burn watch the smoke as I turn Rising a phoenix from the flames I have learned from fighting fights that werent mine Not with fists but with wings that I will fly   
   Im getting by with my wicked ways Im loading up and Im taking names I wanna dig my way to hell I wanna dig my way to hell   Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder Ever heard of

you saw a villain with a cape Ripped a gaping hole in it Flipped out ripped down the drapes Tied em around my neck Went down the fire escape of the Empire State Slipped fell straight down to the ground Splattered all over the entire state And straight to hell got impaled by the gates Saw Satan stuck his face in an ashtray While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face And this aint got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot But by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day Im a combination of Skylar Grey Tyler the Creator and Violent J Its a

  Another day another hotel the inside of its nice though Oh well this is my life so As I go and try to close for the nights show See how far that line goes Still blows my mind show Business guess Ill just never get So this shit just always feels so weird To this day because all I ever did Was just say the shit I wouldve wanted to hear Other people say to me when I was a kid So please dont make me some type of hero Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way But still will have a field day with some of the Fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick Cause I still make fun of a sit Someones in like a son of a bitch At anothers expense Im fuckin relentless As fuck when it comes to this pen I struggle with coming to my senses Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced Its challenging but my conscience allows me to think The most foulish childish things without even blinking Without even thinkin about all the stinkin amounts of people that seem to be reachin in the crowds Im scream in the palace sold out this evening But now its lay me down to sleeping Is it really my soul to keep or Have I sold it cheap is it greed Do I take more than I need When I joke about leavin But keep over achievin Because whats stolen from me barely broke even  Its a fine fine line Its a fine fine line  So I notice how I paint myself And through my hair when ordeals Im so vain I want my respect but ignore the Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect Till I sit in the dark and I reflect And my reflection shows what its like here Cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights yeah Its like a nightmare I said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare And I dont like how I see myself so I Open the Bible to Isaiah cause I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer Ice skate on the nice way Puting it but I like staying Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player I got a nice pair of dice here Sealed off in my lair Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit From in this house its quite bare but it aint when you cant leave it And I feel so isolated nice I made it But its like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it So I bitch about my life then make another song its a cycle aint it Then I wonder why I stay famous Keep walkin the line This gold fish poke gets old But especially when you dont know If your conscience is sayin I told you so You dont even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier Or if you sold your soul  Its a fine fine line Its a fine fine line  And from here you look so small Hovering high above us all Please come back to me  I still remember the times when They were simpler than the rhymes of Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin the mics Ill never forget what that feeling was like I Miss those times now when I was just starting out Without a dime and now Im diamond Cant even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when Ive been Stuck in this house hibernatin Hate even going outside it Sucks sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse I dont even want to buy nothin I just wanna fuckin walk around inside it Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin bout life and Everything about it I miss Which now reminds me Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz Wow I must have had Alzheimers Long time since I shouted them out bout time Cause its been on my mind lately how Zee you always supported me You vouched I will never forget that and How you guys accepted me for me and Pace I love you too you slept on my couch And I been thinkin bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do And regardless how life has turned out Inside Ill always be an outsider My life has been turned inside out but I  Its a fine fine line Its a fine fine line 
  I feel phenomenal as usual Pharmaceuticals glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo But I dont know if Im in Tennessee Chicago or Houston In the corner trying to seek solitude Shallow but such a hollow dude I wont even swallow solid food Alcoholic too plus Im on lean like the Tower of Pisa Top it off Im on mushrooms so fuck all of you Roses to violet mollies are blue Lost in a ball of confusion Its all an illusion Its probably the shrooms Im on Cause I think I started hallucinating Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Futures new shit And all I can do is follow the music And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza Fillin water balloons with nail polish remover Just a problem in wallowing fumes I feel uptight I gotta get looser After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution Concentrated like orange juice so Im not as diluted Cause all this delusion got me seein shit Excusezmoi but that coochie that passed You see her ass Wouldnt make her my main squeeze But juicier ass it belongs in a juicer Its mouth waterin too so I walked up to it like Im Marshall Wanna try to meet my standards Ill Introduce ya Oh Im a misogynist too but Im not a masseuse But my attitude is rubbin off on the youth A chronic abuser not only user of marijuana I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers Got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a Glock and a nuke And a Rottweiler too Im not in the mood so When I say Im bringing the TEC out Im not coming to repair your fuckin electronic computers God Im gonna puke Im so gone off the hookah I think I swallowed a loofah Im tore up demolished a fuckin stone like Oliver Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her The thoughts I produce are loony tunes The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes To replace next up Veronicas boobs And a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues The girl was just not the one suitable for him   Right For Me will change me rearrange my head to be Just right for you and me don t laugh please listen Don t laugh please listen  Thought I could endure the pressure Collapse and crumble perhaps Relapsing under that Well thats a bunch of crap In the clutch Im the Captain Crunch of rap And Im sick of acting humble thats enough of that Fuck that shit cut the sack Like its a natural reaction Thats why Im actually trapped in this shoving match Cause push keeps coming to that I can keep getting my ass kicked keep it coming back Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad Disgruntled had some struggles yeah But that passionate hungers back The fantastic juggling act And the way I flip my tongue on the track Its like verbal acrobatics But in fact Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic I fuckin crashed my hovercraft After I strapped the duffel bag to my back And stuck the massive punchin bag in it An elastic bungee strap proper plaster a thumb tack And a piece of plastic bubble wrap Went spastic and fuckin snapped Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid Stumbled back recovered back flipped And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat And for my last trick lunge on back lash On a NASA shuttle flap fuckin snapped the rudder in half Chuckled and laughed buttaled my last rebuttal And just asked him to come crash And I go grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress And ceramic construction hat Rubbed my magic mushroom tat Fell off then splat get up from that Face taped to a waste paper basket Throw up then gas lungs collapse And thats more

  Yo man Yo Marsh man Youve been kickin all this shit about yourself what about the homies man  Ai you want one about the posse Aight  Oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride Oh oh ph ohh Foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride  Well foolish pride has alot of things to say You got foolish pride you got tooth decay But tooth decay is another problem So lets take this old foolish pride and solve it Now when I talk about foolish pride I mean blacks  whites taking different sides When blacks and whites take different sides Unity never happens and we will subside We will subside and hatred will release And everything will just crush that peace Well when we crush that peace we start hatin each other But remember you are my brother and you are my sister Just like Im a mister I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her I kissed her I placed it on her cheek And she didnt come back til next week  Now it was next week and she was back again Wanting to kiss a white kid So she was my girlfriend we started going out But thats okay because we were Black and white Blacks and whites they sometimes mix But Black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks So Ima say like this Dont date a Black girl take it as a diss If you want but if you dont Ima tell you like this I surely wont Never date a Black girl because Blacks only want your money And that shit aint funny  So Ima say look honey Why do you do this You know you step up to me like you a Brutus Then you try to grab my spinach Because its green and thats cash So get outta here cause I dont need your ass I said that before but thats okay because like I said youre a whore Black girls and white girls just dont mix Because Black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks White girls are good I like white girls I like white girls all over the world White girls are fine and they blow my mind And thats why Im here now telling you this rhyme Cause Black girls I really dont like We dont mix its like riding a bike When youre peddling hard uphill both ways You know its kinda hard and thats why I say to you Im giving you a little advice Dont date a Black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice You wont ever do it again because theyll take your money And that aint funny So Ima say look honey I thought I said that before But like I said again youre nothing but a big whore So when mike catch on the bass line Thats okay cause we will not just waste time  Ill get straight to the point Black girls are bitches thats why Ima tell ya you better pull up your britches Cause all that cash is making your ass drag From the boyfriend ya ganked and thats pretty bad I mean thats pretty sad when ya dating a Black guy And then you turn around and fuck another big Black guy Now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking But thats okay because you need a goddamn spanking From me the funky Eminem Im busting rhymes and Im swallowing phlegm Im busting a freestyle just like this I say swallowing phlegm and Howard gets pissed But when Howard gets pissed thats okay Because he leaves and he doesnt show up for two more days So Ill just worry about that problem when I come to it I cross that bridge when I come to it  Because I forgot the chorus But thats okay cause yall saying bust a rhyme for us So Ima bust another rhyme about this Black girl She turned out to be a fuckin wack girl A wack girl because Black girls aint funny All they want is your godamn money They take you for everything you got And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand So Ima kick it to you just like this How does the chorus go I forgot But thats okay cause Ima tell you in stride Ima say oh foolish pride  Oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride Oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride Oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh oh foolish pride Oh oh oh oh foolish pride oh oh oh Date a white girl cause they got the raw hide

fuck with me Mack magnet attractin enormous green Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack Cause this bitch is that war machine Life of a giant but who needs size when youre wack and your teams soft Drag your girl down this hill til she admits that it feels like shes jackin the beanstalk We both got marketing plans Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me And then go invest into a grocery store Rolled up with the Smith  Wesson and drew on you like lets fight now I do numbers I turn you and your crew into two plumbers Translation get your shit together and pipe down Fuck a mic I dont write I chew and spit Ill shoot you and your sis if you insist I got my eyes on the sparrow Silencers so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel And he doin this   My name is Marshall Im repping that motherfucking Motor City bitch I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet Began to trendset murdered a friends pet Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet Im already covered in sweat and I wasnt even ready to come in yet AHH let me set this drink down Beat up a gal start beef with her pal Probably be wild til Im wrinkled and senile And Rap God was a freestyle Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch And Im freestyling now I need a towel sweat leaks from my brow Its burning my eyes my cerebral is foul Cause shit Im thinking about should be illegal I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio And went to South Beach with his talents Scream fuck you on the way out and wink with a smile This whole game can eat a dick Im going back deep underground But right now Im back on that bullshit and you Im singling out Cause youre so fucking outdated you should mingle a while What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters Bunch of Buster Douglas motherfuckers is one hit wonders One swing and youre crowned Knocked one out the park one catchy jingle and now You think you fucking with me cause you sold like  thou Bitch I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground Reach up swing from a cloud with  thousand people around Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo When Im sprinkled in pico de gallo Mardi Gras beads in a towel I just made that up I dont know much Spanish Im not bilingual But Ill show you a Mexican stand off Between just these two amigos Cause neither really wants to say what were thinking out loud But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English no doubt Cause were trying to kill each other but lyrically The fuck is humility What is a real emcee Royce he came up in the shit with me Never spit that hustler shit it wasnt a fit for me Let them adjust til they just get the gist of me Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history Of muscular distrophy it wasnt a mystery Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning So what in the fuck is a list to me Im used to not being on it I expect it out em Heck wit em I get my respect without em Aint really been into diamonds since I put my first record out But I could put a chain around my second album And wear it as a neck medallion Became a millionaire went downhill from there Became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career The fuck am I gonna do until then This job is too fulfilling Two gajillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville Into some children at the food pavilion and BuildABear Warriors mind I m prohydrocodone euphoria In the Drug Emporium line Im soaring Im pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on em fore I go four wheeler riding Gory and violent and horrifying You surely wont find no one more appalling Than I am with this retaliatorial rhyming for Gloria Steinem But I finger her like a witness show me a lineup I usually am abusive but excuse me maam I guess I mustve threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam When I said I could use the sample cause yous a tramp But look how you react to this trigger like When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam Youre playing right in Lex Luthors hand Its such a ruthless plan might even lose a fan But fuck it Superman wouldnt change in a phone booth for Stan Im a brand new being like Grand Pubas band Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed In his pooper with lubricantwait thats too I cant Since honesty is the best policy Ill give you the old college try Try to acknowledge my mistakes probably wont qualify As a gentleman and a scholar but its time that I swallow pride And say that Im sorry sorry I cant apologize I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughters minds Then Im like dollar signs But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice Play nice bitch Ill punch Lana Del Rey right In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight In plain sight of the elevator surveillance Til her head is banged on the railing Then celebrate with the Ravens Never date an assailant who selfmedicates with inhalants Id meditate but I may need a better way to escape The aggression rage and the anger Cause they restraints on the ankles Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains This aint enough to contain it But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on Stage in a fucking neglig e everyday and Liz Claiborne Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson Wait slut your friends what are they gonna say Cause makeup aint gonna cover That eye thats seveneighths of the way shut Peppersprayed with your face cut Made my bank like a lay up Off these effing skanks on the way up Oh bitch thinks shes heavensent Its evident that she aint never been with seven inches Yes I said seven I measured it Seven inches from the floor While Im standing on the fourth floor balcony At the Sheradon when Im stretching it Bitch Im a pimp so a limp dick is all youll ever get So if shes hesitant to get the hint Ill bet you that I get the message sent who shes messing with Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench Existential detriments to a lesbian devil In the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level That separatists like a Chechnian rebel Impressionist with a pencil A pessimist with his lips pressed against The edge of this Red Bull Pedal to the metal Im rippin this shit cause right away Ill give it to a bitch like a pedestrian deadly as ever You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass SHADYXV as perplexing as The last fifteen years and Im predicting my next relapse When I spit these lyrics so dont look at me weird When I start shifting gears and shit resmears all over Britney Spears And these little Disney queers Who use chicks for beards Just made that up too Oh and the Shady We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls Cause its supposed to confuse you hoes The flows lose you as usual so juvenile year old when I go to the studio Its only music but dont be foolish though You dont know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though In my homies Buick Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it When I step in the vocal booth like Im supposed to do And I murder you on a fuckin track like Tony Stewart In one take if I fuck up and I dont redo it You couldnt sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it The day I dont say fuck you wall you can throw me through it Rootinesttootinest shootin this from the hip With the sentiments Eminem isnt penning them for the women Im an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia They tryna get rid of me gadzooks But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag Of the United States and the freedom I distribute these raps through And if I catch you doing anything Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me that Tattoo of your lips on my ass Imma be literally Pickin up and deliberately whippin the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH  Fuck it  Got it somewhere in there probably

  Lets take them back to the future bars Bars like Paul Rosenberg The small frozen turd dont censor me man Alright look I had class I just got expelled I excelled at nothing in school So if youre tryna test my patience it just failed But King Mathers I still get hailed So call me sire like I exhaled After I had a deep ass breath held I guess well thatll make my size double XL So kiss your highnesss hinded ass While Im trying to stretch its time to exercise Im flexing isometrics Twice the reps til I get extrasized And set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire Cause Im coming out guns blazing Like flaming pythons my suggestion is parental discretion Be advised due to this mental aggression We advise you to back up like Byron Leftwich Im infectious I rhyme like I got a sinus infection A virus Im congested and I just ingested Five Allegras but the side effects from these antidepressants theyre tryna mess with my mind Im a regular Hyde and Jekyll White with freckles but I silence hecklers You might wanna head for the fire exits Im coming through like a wrecking ball You would swear I think highly of Miley And I respect her the way I backhand her Excuse my French Montana but I am worried about nutting God damn it Im a sexist I drive a Lexus Textses out of her mind and Im in Texas With a chainsaw wait what did I forget this Time oh my machetes getting upset he said He was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed It was time hes restless He wants to make blood shed like a storage unit But before I do it let me think this through Cause if I behead this bitch then Id be headless Mic check one two I aint barely check the mic just yet And I just sweared like twice as many times In less than ninety seconds Than Andrew fucking Dice ever did in his fucking life But I guess Im expected to make these kinds of violent records Its why I keep rhyming reckless Fuck it I swear like a diamond necklace Since freestyling over phone tap my lines connected With rhymes that kept in touch with the fans thats why the more bars the better my reception And I give a fuck about sales and fuck pop I dont even like refreshments Cindy Crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw At the waffle house awful mouth But if you dont like what Im talking about then block me out Just then Foxy Brown walks up and knocks me down Kicks me and socks me ow Apparently still mad over what I said last year On that Vegas track I just look stupid and stand there And try to act like I cant hear What Sorry dear but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear Thats when my man Denaun Porter ran behind me to pantomime That if you wanna kick his ass stand in line Hands inside my pants as I fantasize taking advantage Of Brandy and Janet by grabbing my Spanish Fly Like a blind Hispanic guy with his zipper stuck Give a fuck its all part of my grand design To get Amanda Bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion Better watch your step you bout to cross an outlandish mine Im what you get if Aaron Hernandez rhymed So stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy I am with a branding iron Fuck talking clear so you all can hear Id rather rap like a fucking auctioneer Fuck around and walk from here to the Southpaw premier Get on Pauls back rapping Paul Revere So call me queer cause Im always weird So praise a Genius hope this dont get taken out of text But Hillary I promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas Got a name that speaks for itself like Anthony Weiner Hands in between my pants in a theater jacking my meat A fan of Trina Angelina and Christina and Serena and Selena Scarlett Johansson Tiffani Amber Thiessen Give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an Ambien in the Cappuccino And try to have a sum with Janet Reno Im fucked worse than Donald Trump On Lexapro in Mexico across from a Texaco in McDonalds drunk Broke and out of gas busted water pump Getting fondled up by Ronald feeling him on his rump Oh yeah and me and Alyssa Milano hump We do Bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the Run DMC fedora Addidas and Diadoras but I need at least three to four of those Rita Oras In a four seater Taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house Ill let them bleed in my mouth while Im eating them out thats disgusting ow Jesus Heat seeking missile duck demented sick hate and see who gives a fuck I invented prick and thats a true statement I see the bitch in you Caitlyn I keep the pistol tucked like Bruce Jenners dick No disrespect though not at all no pun intended that took a lot
