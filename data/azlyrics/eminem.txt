"Nah that bully wants to beat your ass and Ima let him"    Brain damage ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was goin But everywhere I go they keep playin my song   Brain damage Way before my baby daughter Hailey I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DAngelo Bailey An eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes so everyday hed shove me in the lockers One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin And had me in the position to beat me into submission He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose Soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat I tried to plead and tell him "We shouldnt beef" But he just wouldnt leave he kept chokin me and I couldnt breathe He looked at me and said "You gonna die honkey" The principal walked in Whats going on in here? and started helpin him stomp me I made them think they beat me to death Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left Then I got up and ran to the janitors storage booth Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws Grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools "This is for every time you took my orange juice or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt Im gettin you back bully Now once and for good" I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood Knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot  Made it home later that same day Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray I couldnt even see what I was tryin to read I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed My mother started screamin "What are you on drugs?? Look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug" Sorry She beat me over the head with the remote control opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull I picked it up and screamed "Look bitch what have you done??"  "Oh my God Im sorry son"  "Shut up you cunt" I said "Fuck it" Took it and stuck it back up in my head then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck     Brain damage Its brain damage I got brain damage Its brain damage Its probably brain damage Its brain damage Brain damage I got brain damage

  Ayo This song is dedicated to all the happy people All the happy people who have real nice lives And have no idea what its like to be broke as fuck   I feel like Im walking a tight rope without a circus net Im popping percocets Im a nervous wreck I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged Full of venom and rage Especially when Im engaged And my daughters down to her last diaper Thats got my ass hyper I pray that god answers maybe Ill ask nicer Watching ballers while theyre flossing in their pathfinders These overnight stars becoming autograph signers We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us Along with the small frys and average half pinters While player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us Moneyll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless While snakes slither in the grass spineless   Thats Rock Bottom When this life makes youre mad enough to kill Thats Rock Bottom When you want something bad enough to steal Thats Rock Bottom When you feel like youve had it up to here Cause youre mad enough to scream but youre sad enough to tear   My life is full of empty promises And broken dreams Im hoping things will look up But there aint no job openings I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished Living in this house with no furnace unfurnished And Im sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay And Im tired of being hired and fired the same day But fuck it if you know the rules to the game play Cause when we die we know were all going the same way Its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan When all you need is bucks to be the man Plus a luxury sedan Too comfortable and roomy in a six But they threw me in the mix With all these gloomy lunatics Who walk around depressed And smoke a pound of ses a day And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today My daughter wants to throw the ball but Im too stressed to play Live half my life and throw the rest away    Theres people that love me and people that hate me yup But its the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady I want the money the women the fortune and the fame That means Ill end up burning in hell scorching in flames That means Im stealing your checkbook and forging your name Theres lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain Cause right now I feel like Ive just hit the rock bottom I got problems now everybody on my blocks got em Im done Im screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot em Holding two glocks I hope your doors got new locks on em My daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em And the rings youre wearing look like they got a few rocks on em And while you flaunt em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want em? Cause I never went gold off one song Im running up on someones lawn with guns drawn

   I dont know why this world keep turning Round and Round But I wish it would stop and let me off right now  Yes man As the World Turns We all experience things in life Trials and Tribulations That we all must go through When someone wants to test us When someone tries our patience   I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jackolanterns Outsiders baby and we suing the courts Cause were dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source They never shouldve booted me out of reform school Deformed fooltaking a shit in a warm pool They threw me out the Ramada Inn I said it wasnt me I got a twin Oh my god its you Not again It all started when my mother took my bike away Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave After that It was straight to the 40 ouncers Slappin teachers and jacking off in front of my counselors Class clown freshman dressed like Les Nessman Fuck the next lesson Ill past the test guessing And all the other kids said Eminems a dishead Hell never last the only class hell pass is phys ed May be true till I told this bitch in gym class That she was too fat to swim laps she needed Slim Fast Who Me? Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tannys and stepped on Jenny Craig She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig Put me in the headlock then I thought of my guinea pig I felt the evilness and started transforming RARRRR It began storming I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming Grabbed that bitch by her hair Drag her across the ground And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down Sorry coach its too late to tell me stop While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop    As the World Turns These are the days of our lives These are the things that we must go through Day by day   We drive around in million dollar sports cars While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards Outsiders and we suing the courts Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source Hypochondriac hanging out at the laundromat Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at Dressed like a sailor standing by a pale of garbage Its almost dark and Im still tryna nail a trailor park bitch I met a slut and said "What up its nice to meet ya" Id like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza But Im broke as fuck and I dont get paid till the first of next month But if you care to join me I was bout to roll this next blunt But I aint got no weed no phillies or no papers Plus Im a rapist and a repeated prison escapist So gimme all your money And dont try nothing funny Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me I went to grab my gun Thats when her ass put it on me Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry I fell through the glass doors Started causing a scene Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine Jumped up with a broken back Thank god I was smocking crack all day And doped up off coke and smack All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse Now I wanna kill her But so I gotta catch her first Ran through Rallys parkin lot and took a shortcut Saw the house she ran up in And shot her fucking porch up Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut Looked around the room Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut I know youre in there bitch I got my gun cocked You might as well come out now She said "Come in its unlocked" I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne And seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn She said "Come her big boy lets get acquainted" I turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it She came at me at full speed nothing could stop her I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her I started to beg "No please let go" But she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll With one leg left now Im hoppin around crippled I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple Just trying to buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick Den Den Den Den Den Den Go go gadget dick Whipped that shit out and aint no doubt about it It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage I shouted "Now bitch lets see who gets the best" Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death Ah Ah Come here bitch Come here Take this motherfucking dick Bitch come here    And as we go along Throughout the days of our lives We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday That we must go through These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere Every day Every single day the world keeps turning

   I reckon you aint familiar with these here parts You know theres a story behind that there saloon Twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldnt stop em Quickest damn gunslingers Ive ever seen Got murdered in coldblood That old saloon there was their little "home away from home" They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 59"   I dont speak I float in the air wrapped in a sheet Im not a real person Im a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And a noise is spread picked up and transmitted through Royces head Trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side He made a choice and said   Who hard? Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which onell swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal Im not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay overworked its like the Nazis and the Nation Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth   Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people Hes Evil and Im Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I dont agree with police either Shit me neither We aint eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain Hes insane No Im not I just want to shoot up and Im pissed off Cause I cant find a decent vein   The disaster with dreads Im bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after Im dead When in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred man until they joint chains While slipping bullets at pointblank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whipping human ass throwing blows cracking jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass Im blazing MCs at the same time amazing MCs Somehow MCs aint that eyebrowraising to me From all of angles of us flash a Mack loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt    Hello?

In the paper the news everyday I am I dont know its just the way I am  Im so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label lets stop with the fables Im not gonna be able to top on "My Name is " And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation That got me rotation at rocknroll stations And I just do not got the patience got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep asking The same fucking questions fucking questions What school did I go to what hood I grew up in The why the who what when the where and the how Til Im grabbing my hair and Im tearing it out Cause they driving me crazy driving me crazy I cant take it Im racing Im pacing I stand and I sit And Im thankful for every fan that I get But I cant take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standing by it No I wont sign your autograph You can call me an asshole Im glad   Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am? In the paper the news everyday I am Radio wont even play my jam Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasnt then why would I say I am? In the paper the news everyday I am I dont know its just the way I am

"We aint nothing but mammals" Well some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes  But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope  But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote Women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes   Cause Im Slim Shady yes Im the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up please stand up?

I aint coming in yet Ill come in a minute  AyoThis is my love songit goes like this   Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark This is how we used to make the party start We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark And when it kicks in you can hardly talk And by the sixth gin youre gonna probably crawl And youll be sick then and youll probably barf And my prediction is youre gonna probably fall Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall And everythings spinning Youre beginin to think women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished You are now allowed to officially slap bitches You have the right to remain violent and start wilin Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin you Get in your car start it and start drivin Over the island and cause a 42 car pileup Earth calling pilot to copilot Looking at the life on this planet sir no sign of it All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin And Im so high that I might die if I go by it Let me out of this place Im outta place Im in outer space Ive just vanished without a trace Im going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow Ill be back in an hour or so     Cause every time I go to try to leave Someone keeps pullin on my sleeve I dont wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me  Cause every time I try to tell them "no" They wont let me ever let them go Im a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me   In third grade all I used to do Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubics cube 17 years later Im as Rude as Jude Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs Ive got no game And every face looks the same Theyve got no name So I dont need game to play I just say whatever I want to whoever I want Whenever I want wherever I want however I want However I do show some respect to few As ecstasy got me standing next to you Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you We just met But I think Im in love with you But youre on it too So you tell me you love me too Wake up in the morning like "yo what the fuck we do?" I gotta go bitch You know I have stuff to do Cause if I get caught cheatin then Im stuck with you But in the long run These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later But fuck it Im on one So lets enjoy Let the X destroy your spinal cord So its not a straight line no more Til we walk around looking like some windup dolls Shits sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur Shit six hits wont even get me high no more So bye for now Im going to try to find some more     Thats the sound of a bottle when its hollow When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow And tomorrow youre probably going to want to do it again Whats a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it And whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And whats a little fight? Tomorrow youll be boys again Its your life Live it however you wanna Marijuana is everywhere Where was you brought up? It dont matter as long as you get where youre going Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where were going They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning But youre young Youve got a lot of drugs to do Girls to screw Parties to crash Sucks to be you If I could take it all back now I wouldnt I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldnt But Im all grown up now and upgraded and graduated Did better drugs and updated But Ive still got a lot of growing up to do Ive still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew But when its all said and done Ill be 40 Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories With a bottle of Jack Two grandkids in my lap Babysitting for Hailie while Hailies out getting smashed     Drugs really got a hold of me They really got a hold of me Cause drugs really got a hold of me They really got a hold of me
