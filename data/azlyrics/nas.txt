your place how would I hold up How long would I ride before I fold up How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go You predicted it in every line all in your flow There could Never Be Peace I have to quote Cant believe I heard my name on the realest shit you ever wrote We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top but kept it brotherly when we seen each other and stopped in NYC at MTV people watched We was both deep after you left I got no sleep Think about how us real niggaz would be If we united a nation of thugs who could fight it You was caught in a wild homicide or were you crucified like the son of God when Lucifer lied and make the world think young blacks should be extinct But Thug Lifell never die we stay high and just link Will there ever be another MC as nice Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ  Still somehow I believe we always survive but why   Still we will survive No matter what my people just stay alive Still we will survive No matter what my people just stay alive  I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour Did Smokey Robinson have to shoot his way out a war What has Al Green seen that made him religious Was it the drugs  put an end to the music business If so should I put out the indo right now and write down a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around Cause Im bound for the movie screen cuties that scream Ill need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens It be the ones you always knew that want it on Tellin everybody it was him that you fronted on Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty Not used to walkin in the path of legit money I thought I made it but we only took baby steps Up the success ladder where they pay me checks To my clicks when I got it I said Baby bless That was the s but now look at this crazy mess We in the s and finally its lookin good Hiphop took it to billions I knew we would A lot of ups and downs in the game could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin to maintain  one day you here the next you not when you around niggaz check em out Some is bout it most individuals plots and run the spots some choose to stay to theyselves While others have no cares and stay in jail More than fifty percent of us endin up with holes through the chest through the head through the gut it shows The future for us young shooters and old killers Who become rich as dope dealers Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments Thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench either that or rap We want the fast way outta this trap Whether it be  to  or slangin crack To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back But life is a dream and yall taught me that  always survive but why   Always survive always Still we will survive No matter what my people just stay alive Still we will survive No matter what my people just stay alive Still we will survive no matter what Still we will survive no matter what Still we will survive No matter what my niggaz just stay alive
