  Yo let us talk about being leaders Or let us talk about leading anew How about lets talk about Being a leader of the new school  I do want us to look at how leaders are made right So leaders are not being made In the same way that they used to And when leadership is being made Theres no sacrifice theres no scarring Theres no embedding of pain Theres certain things that have to go into leadership That will sustain it Leadership is not all popularity It is not all fun Doin things behind the shadow of a leader right And another leader So part of my gifting to this generation Is to invite them to know That there is a season and a time for everything right And do not rush your time do not rush your time Some things have to be made through pain And not just through the glamour of life As we have here today Wow Say it again Preach  As we always aspire to aspire More greatly Just know there will always be Only one leaders of the new school Forever
