   This is the end Hold your breathe and count to ten Feel the earth move and then Hear my heart burst again For this is the end Ive drowned and dreamt this moment So overdue I owe them Swept away Im stolen   Yeah Its been a long time coming and you know its all I got Ive been sacrificing for years while the rest of yall have not These motherfuckers want my spot because we slippin out they knot So Im a do this shit until the day my body rot I said Im a give it my all Never slippin I wont fall Down to fight right to the death you know Ive been ready to brawl Swear to God Ive seen it all Hold up let me paint that picture I was poor you was richer But Im in the ring witchu Hold up wait now let me hit you with some real shit Open up your mind maybe youll find that you can feel this I had nothing came up with somethin and I still got it Motivated by the shit Ive seen boy its so hypnotic Yeah look to my left and see my brothers selling drugs Uh look to my right and see my sisters fucking thugs It aint funny how this life go One moment youre in the dark but when that light glow Its like youre seeing for the first time As I penetrate your mind Like a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine Im givin everything I got so yeah it better be my time They said Id never make it thats the reason I still rhyme now   
  Aight well higher probably right Fuck it just record it Who cares  I just wanna make this music lovers remember again While the haters fall back like September again I was hoping  Stacks and Big would assemble again Drop the politics and bring us together again Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then Yeah yeah But Im not defined by the sales of my first week Cause in my mind the only way if fail if my verse weak As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces Compiled of different races gathering from different places I just contemplate Shoutout to those who can relate And even though it gets hard I know my fate With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates It s like Imma get up today I don t know how but Imma find a way Looking for the sun in a world of grey Feeling like my dreams is a world away Imma get up today I don t know how but Imma find a way Searching for the sun in a world of grey Feeling like my dreams is a world away What it feel like I used to wonder what it feel like Yeah used to wonder what it   I used to wonder what it feel like But now I know achieved the goal I ran the race I won the gold  I used to wonder what it feel like You can really do anything  Hello Welcome to the Under Pressure program My name is Thalia I will be here to assist you With the information about the album and its creation

  Thomas  Kai Okay so what do you think life was like before the fall I mean weve seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it I just cant imagine life anywhere but inside a space station I mean the simple concept of a sky doesnt even fully register  We do have fields on the Babel station and also  Yeah yeah but thats all synthetic I mean were heading to this planet right That we call Paradise because we hope it can sustain life why  Because well eventually run out of resources  Exactly I mean what if we got there and its exactly as the data predicted beautiful lush Then we destroy it just like we did Earth Theres only  million human beings left in the universe I mean its weird to think about the fact that in  the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel  Man whats your point  The point is  ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this damn near all of them return without any luck some of them didnt return at all I guess my fear isnt that we wont find paradise Its that well create purgatory 
  Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious hella vicious I wonder where is this hold up Get the fuck out my business show enough We roll up then load up Just a bastard born in a wedlock Close to the Earth like a dreadlock Got my sites on deadlock Visions of my enemy in a headlock Feel like Im livin in Bedrock surrounded by rubble Just a youngin in trouble Took a shot and then made it a double Took a shot and then made it a double This that food for thought my school aint taught me good No one greedy inside my hood But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon make it good like it should Thats ignant isnt it Hold up now wait take a look at my pigment Tell me again we can never be kin based on the color of my skin Matter of fact your lips aint thin Thats a club I dont wanna be in My DNA get done integrated My God its innovative Thats a million miles away from administrative I fuckin hate it anyway Long ago way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park I was like  sit in my mama lap while she would drive Police would knock on the door I would hide Then they would talk to me and I would lie Hopin I dont die on this side of a Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away Over down on the driveway Fast forward a couple of years and Im bumpin that Sade Fast forward a couple of more and Im bumpin that My Way By Sinatra so high so high oh my God damn Now Im a grown man oh man What the fuck done happened to the plan I know as soon as I write this I might just go crazy Anything but lazy I cant sleep Cause if I do theres another motherfucker wide awake on the creep Tryna kill you and he will too We livin like civilized people but far from equal I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel My son my seed Watch em grown and then watch em lead Let me proceed bumpin that that Californication by the Red Hot Fuck around and then hit em with a red dot Yall better not me fuckin with me Who him Yeah me I be the God MC   Follow me to paradise Follow follow me Follow me to paradise Follow me to paradise Follow follow me Follow me to paradise  I remember my life long ago in my adolescence I could feel the presence in my residence Hesitant even thought it was evident I should get the fuck I know something is wrong Yeah I know something is wrong Feel like my mind gone I know I play along I might drown in this song Huh Im so focused huh I know you know this Uh when I make a move and feel like no one notice Uh when I quit my job uh I fuckin noticed Shit made me been unnoticed huh but maybe not Feel like this minimum wage is contagious So outrageous my age is on my mind Walking to work and I go blind Sippin on that Koolaid gettin big wig money thats toup e Look around and see people with no class like snow on a school day Yall cant do what I do do what I do Starin out this window like like Erykah Badu Livin life how I do is crazy This shit never amaze me But I still let it phase me and I dont know why All I know is my mind racing A million miles a minute the second Im in it yeah I be pacing Bitch Im back again Been here since way back when now let that shit begin  This album  but this song was written before the first My mind racing Im sick of pacing I feel the thirst Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise But it only makes it that much better when I rise  This for the people that been through it and couldnt do it Had a vision but blew it while haters screaming I knew it This is real so real The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill Most of these people will never hit fruition Paying tuition when they shouldve just listened their intuition Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle All alone with no one to dial Im just a man I got problems understand This is all I ever wanted yes I do it for the fans And I aint perfect Ive questioned if this life was even worth it Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface And my purpose is to do it like it aint never been done Always keep it real and remember where Im from now  This album  but this song was written before the first My mind racing Im sick of pacing I feel the thirst Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise But it only makes it that much better when I rise 
  Ive been workin like Ive never been I struggle every day but I just cant let the devil in And if I knew back then what I know right now What I know right now Id be better than Ive ever been better than Ive ever been  You ever wonder what it all really means Heart full of dreams I know Imma do it get it by any means Serving food for the thought like its rock to the fiends I said this shit for years boy this life aint what it seems Sayin that you cant just solidifies that you never will Said you would said you could but you aint got the skill You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill You gotta climb over your ego to master your will Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension God damn I hope youre here for the intervention You say you would if you had the money dont make me mention That itll cost you nothin but time for you to pay attention Now dont get me wrong I know theres people out there hatin on ya And it feel like your selfesteem is breakin on ya All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak They spend seven days preyin on the weak I know the world sleepin on ya like a sedative Talk all you want about me homie Imma let it live Hater this hater that say I sound repetitive Hatin in your blood you was born to be negative  Never been I struggle every day but I just cant let the devil in And if I knew back then what I know right now What I know right now Id be better than Ive ever been better than Ive ever been  This is dedicated to everyone that never made it And the people that persevered even though they was hated They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion But on the real the road to success is prone to collision And every now and then something happens thats unexpected Like that newborn in your life because you fuckin unprotected And I swear nobody perfect hell I know I aint Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but Im far from a saint Live a life with no complaints tryna do just what I can Learn from my fathers mistakes and become a better man Now plant a seed and watch em grow teach em everything I know Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe And this I know cause I been high low right wrong But I had to do it all just so I could write this song I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son And grip the mic like Im at war and its my only gun Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one Yeah and this victory lap a lonely run While my hometown screamin you the chosen one Tellin myself dont choke dont be the frozen one  Ive been workin like Ive never been I struggle every day but I just cant let the devil in And if I knew back then what I know right now What I know right you Id be better than Ive ever been better than Ive ever been   Um you like that take I like it You sure  or I think its good hey Bobby run it 
  Me and my team gotta intervene Whats the point of livin if you aint livin a dream We live in a world where everybody want everything Everybody want a better thing Tryna feel ya like its picture perfect but its just the editing Man the game been waiting for a better king Ive been posted with my Queen like Coretta King Screaming Money aint a thing cause it aint Man I never knew livin out a dream meant livin out a suitcase Ive been working at a new pace So much money on the road I aint even had a minute Not a single second chilling in my new place Motherfuckers getting twofaced Cause a brother finally eating Not to mention everybody gettin two plates You know I only got two traits Drop hits get money Run it  What the fuck is there left to talk about I told them my vision let em know what its all about Industry only respect me because Im ballin out You never know who there for you until you fallin out And thats the reason why Ive been in the kitchen Working on that nutrition I let em listen boy this been my house This is merely an addiction fuck em and their permission They was killin the game who the one that gave em remission You know the name Who else you know wanna come up do it like I does it Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it Say my last shit a classic and I wonder was it Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it I was workin on a budget Second time around shit is different cuh they know that boy good know he does it Ive been at it for the people that been lovin my shit Not the people that been hating they can suck my dick Run it  Im a do somethin different for the last one Im a go in  Feelin like Matthew Mcconaughey on a Interstellar mission in Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera I wonder who I would be if I wasnt in my era I got a berretta for people but I take care of the people when I jump in the cockpit and rock it Been done had this in my pocket I had to wait to unlock it Open that locket and see the picture I painted No we aint never aquainted On the rise look at defending Now we trial for possession like an exorcism My division is solely my vision God damn Can you feel it Uh I had a dream I would run the game and kill it Had a dream can you feel it Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit Get up in it make the shit infinite Yeah you know I wanna win it on my independent Ive been at it like an addict Never at the party like Im democratic Lotta static on the radio Fuck everything that they represent This right here is heaven sent never irrelevant No never when I slide up in the spot just a youngin in the game Tryna show em what I got way back That was the mentality never truly reality Looking for validation With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation Just chillin at the crib on a Playstation Cause I never thought about it never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation Til I wised up got em sized up Ready to go Im feelin fired up Man its been a good ride up Everybody want me to lace em Im too tied up This a ransom Fist full of money then we had back to the mansion thousand people in the crowd we expanding Couple years back you aint give a damn Autographs off the plane whenever I land All part of the plan And anything you wanna do you can Just go and get it fuck em if they dont love em Be above it less youre thinking your profession gon be rap Matter fact you should take a step back Cause I run it 
  Whatd you wanna be when you grew up Honestly a musician What I know man crazy right Nah whats crazy is original music hasnt been created since Earth I know man Lucidity What Back then people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness Shit we took for granted was obvious water food supply Its insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise I guess thats what Im looking for What being able to make music Not just that If the laws are abolished following the migration  were free dude Were not slaves Thomas We arent You cant do anything outside the cause not really Thats why we watch the same movies and listen to the same music I mean dont get me wrong the catalogue is incredible but we need I dont know Something more Yeah somethin more 
  Get em  Living life on the east coast Way back in the day trying to beat most Anybody that wanna do what I do Well let me keep it one hunna with you It ain t about that Ain t about Hip Hop Ain t about Rap Think a minute hold up use your cap Chicago know I mma snap Gotta say no basic rapping  So they wonder who am I so high I said they wonder who am I so high  Back again never outside so I m acting in I laugh again when they don t understand what I mean bias Everybody seen by us Everybody wanna live a life like this Man fuck that do what s good for your family Make music like there s no Grammy For that last line they might ban me I don t give a fuck though Cause I am me From Beijing to Miami I mma just do what I do with my crew Ain t no telling what I m finna do But I promise that I mma keep writing for you And I know what to do Everything right here for you Only for you depending on what you gonna do  It s all for you It s all for you Who am I so high I said they wonder who am I so high  Let me take the time to find the rhyme And let you know that I m the only one To find the one the time is done Beyond the sky beyond the sun There is no one besides the only one And you know I gotta let  em know If you love it let it go At an all time low and all I know is all I know I do what I love Came from below when there was no one above Created a world no one has been to Everything that I m into Everything that I ve been through Bring it back like let it shine like a bad light Reminisce ain t know that night Gotta take flight Everybody probably wonder what I m living like In the middle of the night I might write Despite what they say is right and wrong Despite they wonder wonder  Who am I so high I said they wonder who am I so high  We d like to be painters we d like to be poets We d like to be writers but as everybody knows we can t earn any money that way What do you want to do When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do I will say to him you do that and uhm forget the money If you say that getting the money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time  You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others will  But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing so it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question What do I desire  The Incredible True Story And Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World   Surface contact in  meters meters meters Time of day is  Constant Meridian feet Oxygen Temperature is  degrees Celsius   Man what are the chances that there s some big ass creature out there that s going to eat us      Fuck   Clear Skies   Kai which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best   I would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill   feet   Man stylistically he s like what s the name of that bitch the lead character I forgot her name but he s like that bitch with like some KungFu shit he s like with his raps It s fucking crazy   You know inin Pulp Fiction I mean the way Tarantino constructed his shots it s the same feel for me with his raps you know there s thought behind it   No I could see that I could see that but Nah man fuck that man Kill Bill was the shit especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other s heads off what the fuck is that   Yeahfuck it   Prepare for surface landing   You re right hot chicks and KungFu can t beat that   Yeah can t beat that at all   Surface contact in   Are you ready for this   Are you Wait wait whats that sound   Life

  Im just a spectator looking in But I can tell you how I think things shouldve been And all the reasons why the worlds where it is today Please listen to my words what I have to say You see in Gaza theyre fighting for land You see they need this land cause its a part of their plan understand The Jews needed a place after Hitler So they got about three quarters of Palestinian land Palestinians then had to make refuges In places like Lebanon In places where none of them had ever gone Thousands were massacred for not leaving See Id do the same kill me Ill die believing I understand the mind of a man who commits suicide But dont agree with any innocent that has to die And whats gonna happen after this Will they stop with the Gaza strip I dont think so I sat with a Jew to learn He told me thats its not meant to go to Israel until the prophet returns I said is this true He told me go and read the Torah Cause if its true then theyre following another order How can a nation that knows what its like to be slaughtered go and do the same to someone else Im just a spectator looking in But I can tell you how I think things shouldve been A couple reasons why the worlds where it is today Please listen to my words what I have to say I dont know everything and never will I claim to know What our purpose is and what we really need to grow But I do know were dying for a common cause A global word that is well known war Ive been to Africa and seen a grown man on the floor Disabled to the point I couldnt look anymore A real beggar in a real state of poverty But he prays everyday so he knows that theres gotta be another life Where he can live as a strong man And the ownership of Africa doesnt end up in the wrong hands Western palms Buying and destroying people just to trade arms Could someone tell me why Africa is just surviving The whole land was a resource plus they got diamonds Used to be able to run your hand through the sand And get a handful of diamonds do you understand How precious is the land if its like that You see its wrong to say it was taken by the white man It was taken by the power hungry And the people that never saw the beauty of Africa fam They only saw the money to them it was the land of opportunity Its terrorism when its done by either you or me Treat these words like my eulogy And remember that I died being exactly what I choose to be InshaAllah we all can see That God is the goodness in you and me No religion has ownership See the Quran and the Bible and the Torah were all wrote with ink See I think the masses are miseducated See most of the politicians were born racist See its obvious that somehow were all related Millions of years back before we separated I heard Tony Benn say it in a speech See how can you murder another brother because hes weak Your ancestors could have been cousins so take a seat And try and reason with your brother fam before you beef Im just a spectator looking in from my view Im not different or special Im just like you Bleed blood and shed tears when my hearts hurting I get energy from everything in life Im learning How to say my thoughts release my stress through my words Make you visualise everything youve ever heard Picture ancient Egyptians meditating To the elements telepathically debating Until the pirates came in the form of tradesmen Promised them a Paradise in exchange for a Heaven Temptation and misinterpretation so they jeopardise the whole of the nation You see a Paradise is where we might choose to go But a Heaven is the place where the angels go So they can reason with the prophets not bathe in gold And its not late for no one to save your soul Im a citizen of truth love and loyalty Every person on the planet is royalty These are my thoughts how I look at things Fam Im just a spectator looking in
