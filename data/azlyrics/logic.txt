Baby girl can I love? I said mama can I love? Yea can I love?  I wanna laugh with you Run the water and take a bath with you Stay up late and watch romantic comedies When it comes down to it youre my hearts commodity Yea and now Im feeling like a fool Writing love letters that youll probably never get And right now I love you more than Id like to admit Because were separated Onto you this song is dedicated Im love sick and I need you to medicate it Feeling devastated I think about the past And now I hate it Cause all it proves it that whenever made it Uh see me and shorty got history like a textbook But lately our position is changed like that sex book Ms Independent she the type to hold her own Late night contemplating all alone The kingdom is empty without the queen upon the throne  Can I love?

Cause I know that I wasnt destined to live a life of crime I remember Christmass with no presents I use to fear my future now I dread my adolescence Living a life of logic But it aint what its cut out to be Cause if I couldnt rap yall wouldnt give a fuck about me Hip hop is politics Filled with nothing but strife and stress Time is money and its hard to invest Step on the stage I get the honeys so wet Rockin thousand dollar tuxes sippin on nothing but Moet Thinking Im so set but really I aint done shit yet This game is war and in my mind Im like a Vietnam vet Now Im on the come up Anything that yall do Ill one up Yall grind till 3 in the morning I grind till the sun up Homie thats dedication This world is what Im facing I only hope in the end that they all love and embrace em     For the motherfuckers that hated I made it Slowly elevated escalated onto another level ha My flow is crack the game is Whitney yeah Fame is Bobby on their first date it aint hit me yet Visualizing driving down the horizon While you despising the fact that Im rising So much hate within this world this shit is so traumatizing Steppin to me yeah you better be alphabetically ready Aim steady Lyricism sharp as machete I got it already See I was born to sell records You was destined to sell tunes All up your headphones Killing booths like cellphones I got it Cause everything aint what is seems It aint just him it takes a team At the ten headed to the zone in his mug mean Yeah the quarterback shines but not without a sense of safety So truly he is me and motherfucker you cant face me Now Ive had a lot of doubt I thought I had to throw that out Cause I find that they listen when I rhyme not when I shout And right now shit is rocky With me and my girl See music is my moon but this shawty is my world Think about you all the time Turn that shit into a rhyme Cause sometimes you can ignore me But the beat listens just fine Tell me do you even know If you truly want to grow Hate letters when Im writing Love Jones all I know Cause everything aint what it seems     Living a life you only dream about Flow angelic but now its time to bring the demon out Can you feel me? I said its hard being a saint inside a sinners body You know its hard living as Logic after living as Bobby This is the life I depicted As a child I picked it Feeling conflicted To music I am addicted Not one of yall can predict it So many bars Im feeling convicted Now writing like a felony Im selling homie who you telling While yall do everything by the book fuck that Im rebelling Bitch Im on another level A level you aint seen A level that is truly only deemed for a king The second you listen its my mission to murder any rendition Busting with precision If you in my vision Im never missing Logic administer sinister verses like a minister for the listener Can you motherfuckers feel me?

"I hate summer I hate her crooked teeth I hate her 1960s haircut I hate her knobby knees I hate her cockroachshaped splotch on her neck I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks I hate the way she sounds when she laughs"   Uh She used to be my girl But now she just a girl Im fucking She used to mean the world to me but now that world is nothing I wouldve put a ring on that finger but I couldnt afford it So I laced it with rib and she adored it Uh sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively How could the pussy be that good? Cause my feelings involved Till my shorty evolved And her feelings dissolved But thats what happens when you find them young Treat them like royalty and they will run Searching the world for perfect love and realize youre the one But they fucked because that shit is done This is a letter to the woman of my dreams Love what she brings So listen baby girl cause everything aint what it seems You either know me now Or Im a meet you after fame But one things for sure Your life will never be the same Cause youre gonna be my wife and my mistress So understand now I cant be there for every Christmas I love you more than anything but I could never risk this On stage living life while youre forced to miss this
