   The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic Theres a frantic effort under way tonight to find survivors There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight People are being forced to live like animals We are desperate No one says the federal government is doing a good job And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people No water I fought my country for years We need help we really need help In Baghdad they they drop they air drop water food to peoplewhy cant they do that to their own people The same idiots that cant get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to win a war   People was poor before the hurricane came But the down pour poured is like when Mary J sang Every day it rains so every day the pain But ignored them and showed em the risk was to blame For life is a chain cause and effected Niggas off the chain because they affected Its a dirty game so whatever is effective From weed to selling kane gotta put that in effect Wouldnt you loot if you didnt have the loot Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop Through his telescopic lens but he didnt scoop you The next five days no help ensued They called you a refugee because you seek refuge The commanderinchief just flew by Did he stop No he had a couple seats Just proved jet blue hes not Jet flew by the spot What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped huThat woulda been something to watch Helicopters doing flybys to take a couple of shots Couple of portraits then ignored em Hed be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids Poor kids just cause they were poor kids Left em on they porches same old story in New Orleans Silly rappers because we got a couple Porches MTV stopped by to film our fortresses We forget the unfortunate Sure I ponied up a mill but I didnt give my time So in reality I didnt give a dime or a damn I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded Nothin but a bandit Left them folks abandoned Damn that money that we gave was just a bandaid Cant say we better off than we was before In synopsis this is my minority report Cant say we better off than we was before In synopsis this is my minority report   So many times Im covering my eyes Peeking through my fingers Tryin to hide my frustration at the way that we treat Seems like we dont even care Turn on the TV seein the pain Sayin such a shame Then tryin to go on with my life Of that I too am guilty Seems like we dont even care So we send a lil money tell em its alright To be able to sleep at night You will pay that price While some of these folks lost their whole life Seems like we dont even care Now it wasnt on the nightly news no more Suddenly it didnt matter to you no more In the end almost nothing changed What the hell what was that for Seems like we dont even care   Buses are on the way to take those people from New Orleans to Houston They lyin People are dying at the convention center Their government has failed them George Bush doesnt care about black people 
   Life is but a dream to me I dont wanna wake up Thirty odd years without having my cake up So Im about my paper in a leap year I dont know why we here Since we gotta be here Life is but a beach chair Went from having shabby clothes Crossing over Abbey Roads Hear my angels singing to me Are you happy HOV I just hope Im hearing right Karmas got me fearing life Colleek are you praying for me See I got demons in my past So I got daughters on the way If the prophecys correct Then the child should have to pay For the sins of a father So I barter my tomorrows Against my yesterdays In hopes that shell be OK And when Im no longer here To shade her face from the glare Ill give her my share of Carols Daughter and a new beach chair   Life is but a dream to me Gun shots sing to these Other guys but lullabies Dont mean a thing to me Im not afraid of dying Im afraid of not trying Everyday hit every wave Like Im Hawaiian I dont surf the net No I never been on myspace Too busy letting my voice vibrate Carving out my space In this world of fly girls Cutthroats   diamond cut ropes I twirls Benzs round corners Where the sun dont shine I let the wheels give a glimpse Of hope of ones grind Some said HOV how you get so fly I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky My physicals a shell So when I say farewell My soul will find an even Higher plane to dwell So fly you shall So have no fear just know that Life is but a beach chair   Life is but a dream Cant mimic my life Im the thinnest cut slice Intercut the winners cup With winters rough enough TO interrupt life Thats why Im both The saint  the sinner Nice This is Jay everyday No compromise No compass comes with this life Just eyes So to map it out You must look inside Sure books can guide you But your heart defines you Chica You corason is what brought us home In great shape like Heidi Klum Maricon I am on Permanent Vaca Life is but a beach chair This song is like a Hallmark card Until you read each here So till shes here And she declared The aire I will prepare A blueprint for you to print A map for you to get back A guide for your eyes And so you wont lose scent Ill make a stink for you to think I ink these verses full of prose So you wont get conned out of  cent My last will and testament I leave my heir My share of RocAFella Records and a new beach chair
