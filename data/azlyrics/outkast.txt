  I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album You looked at me like yeah nigga right But you gave me your number anyway you were on the talcum Powder hows about them oranges Moved away from home to school with big plans By day studied the history of music By night just to pay for that shit youd dance To get your pants was a Mission Impossible We were both the same age but I Suppose wasnt on the same page but in The same book of life so Id paged you when I felt you that were getting off of work Or either when youre on your way to school We started hanging like Ernie and Bert And in my idle head Im thinking cool Just when I think Im going down your shirt Youre hiking up your skirt now The events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be Heaven or hell The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best Therefore hard to tell Youd dropped me off by the dungeon Never came in but I knew that you were wondering Now are these niggas in this house up to something Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function Well yes and no Yes we were selling it But no it wasnt blow Cook it in the basement then move it at a show Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled ho Meanwhile the video starts playing BET college radio and a van Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand And one in their ear You know what Im saying But I kept your number in my old phone Got a new chip flip with the roam roam So it took me a minute to retrieve  digits But I promised I would call you when I got home But when I got home I never did By the time I did heard that you had a kid By some nigga in Decatur Who replied see you later when he got the good news thats life shit Now Im  with a Cadillac My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack Got a plaque but Im living with my pop pop So I got Glock and a low jack You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw And never said much cause half of what he saw Was so far from that place you wanna be That words only fucked it up more follow me Are you starting to gather what Im getting at Now if Im losing you tell me then Ill double back But keep in mind at the time keep it real was the phrase Silly once said now but those were the days When Spring Break and Daytona and Freakniks Made you want to drop out of college and never go back Move to the south but that aint a Kodak Moment on went myself and Big Boi Well you knew him as Twan Thats right you were around before this shit begun When Twan had a daughter and Sort of was made to mature before the first tour We hit the road like jack Laughed and cried and drived it back with some Yak Girls used to say yall talk funny yall from the islands And Id laugh and theyd just keep smiling No Im from Atlanta baby He from Savannah maybe We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we Got to go because the bus is pulling out in  minutes Shes playing tennis disturbing the tenants love fit like glove Description is like  doves In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost Making one woozy in the head and comatose agree Enough about me hows about you Hows the lil kid She was about  the last time we spoke I hadnt smoked or took a shot of drink Cause Id start the nd album off on another note Now that note threw some niggas in the hood off But see Id balled out and before I fall out Id Slow my Lac down to a nice speed The brain is that fried egg I might need New direction was apparent I was a child looking at the floor staring So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast Yes I was on the rise yeast was the street To make bread  never primary concern Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn Id meet Muslims gangstas bitches rastas and macaroni niggas imposters So on a trip to New York on some beeswax I get invited to a club where emcees at And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with Which I was rocking at the time When I was going through them phases trying to find Anything that seemed real in the world Still searching but I started liking this girl Now you know her as Erykah On and On Badu Call Tyrone on the phone why you Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed The song wasnt about me and that aint my name Were young in love in short we had fun No regrets no abortion had a son By the name of  and hes By the time I do this mix hell probably be You do the arithmetic We do the language arts Yall stand against the wall blindfolded we throw the darts To poke you in the heart And take you from the start To when luxury transportation meant a Marta card Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because shes smart Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor And he sells you that Rabbit thats been sitting in his yard You fix it up you trick it out you give it rims you give it bump You give it all your time because thats all you can think about And thats as far as I got  And thats as far as I got and where I wanted to go Knowing the whole time thats all you could think about Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up You need a jump like youll need and youll want to grow And you change all the time so that Rabbit that you thought about That whole summer the next summer you didnt want that Rabbit no more You wanted something bigger and better  So the summer past and now the Rabbits old  Rightright so now you want a Cadillac

  The feeling of being  years old and waking up in the middle of the night and somebody in yo room Yo heart starts beating so fast you can hear it pumping The veins in yo temple pulsate as you stare at the intruder Then after a few minutes you realize he aint moving So finally you let em hang and turn on the light and the killer turns into yo coat throwed over the chair  The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning and two or three motherfuckers cross the street Yo senses heighten reflexes sharpen visions enhanced adrenaline flows as they rush across the street you leave the print from the heater grip in yo palm then yo heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just goin to the store  Many of us mistake Phobia for true fear Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for selfpreservation Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence Through stereotyping innuendo false documentation and glorification theyll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie Death is a small price to pay for respect Death is a small price to pay for respect You know who it is You know what it is Peace out    In these troublin times a nigga like me be thinkin of rhymes that makes my quarters nickels plus my pennies and my dimes stack Dont be lookin for
