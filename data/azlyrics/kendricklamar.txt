http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kendricklamar/wannabeheard.html::   Its like I dont think you fully understand who I am yknow Im just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap I dont represent no colors I represent my lil sisters and brothers Im the oldest nigga And if you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack Check it out  I used to wanna rap like JayZ until I finally realised that Jay wasnt me I took my time to jot down every line thats a quotable Critics say I dont be killing this shit but I know I do because I used to practice early morning and then after school Im working on my hooks my nigga I aint tryna battle you But even if I did I guarantee Id overshadow you Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut Ima close cut to Common and Gucci Mane Now thats a comparison that you probably wouldnt understand Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto as an  Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror I wear a heart on my shoulder Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over Then went to jail when we got older That shit is a bad odor but still I remain focussed In due time Ill be able to swipe my card and it wont say decline That shits embarrassing huh Hope no one pay you no mind But its a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line Can you relate to my story Can you follow my dreams and admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen My momma believed in me she let me use her van to go to the studio even though she know her tank is empty thats who I do it fo My pops got a different approach yeah he believed But he always questioned when Ima drop my debut CD How long this gon take nigga You still havent ate nigga At twentytwo I had two cars and my own place nigga Its a sacrifice I try to tell him Thats when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous of all these niggas getting money and their shit dont sound like shit I ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit I just wanna hear you heard   Yep yep thats my word Make a statement with these nouns and verbs I represent the liquor thats poured out on the curb Listen to my nouns and verbs man I wanna be heard Like a cattle with sheep While yall sleep I reup cooking up all day like a mad scientist in that laboratory Motherfuck what a critic got to say Ima be heard   What up Dasan I aint forgot nigga You developed me telling me I was hot nigga You believed in me first thats whats for sure At the church recording at the garage but it worked But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion A lot was going on in your life and you needed space But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened But I was seventeen and figured its best I stay away And I wrong I was young and couldnt look you in the eye for what Id done But Im telling you we aint done Matter of fact hows your sons What they up to Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning with school in the morning yawning but I was on it Me you and Dave was on it Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped Where them beats nigga Its been five years since we had rocked Time to be heard     So can you feel it When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing Word to Spike Lee dont he look like Sounwave Thats kinda random but my humor sometimes strays like a dog in the night Twentyfour hours in a day but only take five minutes to grab a pad and a pen then send your dog a kite I spread love like a Hippy but Im a Black one with Jesus Christ passion I swear on the bible Tabernacle to all my rivals I aint mad You hate a nigga for tryna help you thats your bad because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas I probably cant heal cancer but I can heal the city My niggas tell me you with me And if you is wont you pop my CD in Open up your trunk then let it bump so I can be heard Yeah uh huh     DDave what up nigga Matt Jeezy

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kendricklamar/unclebobbyjasonkeaton.html::   I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper A letter in reply seven days later after I wrote him stay strong keep your faith in God what I told him hoping that hes listening Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years What a coincidence I was bumping some Plies I can taste the salt from my tears as the water had start to flood on my eyes I know it gotta be hard being twentyone Doing time in the pen and your gramps old Your brothers getting older and the streets is getting colder and youre hoping that hes focussed to stay on the right road Sleeping in a cell its been thirty weeks Aint received any mail its cold and the hole stinks And you cant even blink without niggas testing your life As I read every word that you write I can only imagine Jason Keaton I can only imagine yeah   Lifes about decisions man Its in your hand and you got it Just take control if you can Its in your hand and you got it   Sitting on the couch that was my Uncle Bobby after he just got out fifteen years to count Havent seen the world in so long havent seen a girl in so long and before the sun came up he was gone like a fiend off the best rock Trying to get his life together or whatnot Typed his name in the system and they couldnt find his identity Got it straight got a place found some serenity Found a job found his mother gravesite found a forty ounce Then he found God then he bounced Then he found a new chick two kids wide hips Found something in her we didnt see Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her an investment Then found guilty somebody had yelled domestic Violence on my Uncle was working with two strikes Only out a year now facing life I can only imagine Thats fucked up I can only imagine Uncle Bob     Sitting on the couch thinking bout the ratio of blacks in prison its compact in prison when blacks packed with minorities system grab more of these eighteenyearolds eighteenyear sentence with no parole the state wont oversee They make the term severe a conspiracy Thats what I call it its full of shit a toilet can help quick The government help No just put us on death row Just give us some more guns then give us some more coke Then give us another chair then give us some more rope Then hang it like right there yeah its justice for all But ninetypercent unfair care Nah Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand with intentions to expand more prisons So these correctionals aint for rehabilitation They for grossing a bigger business imagine We being used imagine the truth shall be told   
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kendricklamar/faith.html::   Cloud nine Kendrick Lamar uh I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk I aint a drinker Im a thinker call it what you want But if you turn your back know that you just missed your chance to witness the realest shit thats ever been told to man I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service Embarrassed so I started questioning God what is my purpose He say to live the way he did thats all he want from me Spread the word and witness he rose on the first Sunday I said alright enthused that my Lord gave a listen I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian and this from a person that never believed in religion But shit my life is so fucked up man I cant help but give in Im giving testimonies to strangers I never met Hopped on the pulpit and told em how I was truly blessed Felt like Im free from all my sins when the service was over Walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered and lost my faith again   What am I gonna do Gotta have faith Life is too much understood Where is your faith Oh faaaaaaaith All you need is the size of a mustard seed   Single black parent from Compton raising children of four Thats four innocent bastards cause papa they dont know Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters Cant find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister Her baby daddy aint bout shit that nigga aint bout shit Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit She pray to God every night hoping that hell mature and maybe one day his kids something that hell live for Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help because its hard tryna pay the bills when youre by yourself She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice that said the Devil is a lie make a better choice And so its back to McDonalds and every month dealing with them crazy ass people at the county building Looked to the heavens and asked em to make a better way Then got a letter in the mail lost her section Then lost her faith again     Kendrick I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga This about how faith works yeah murk it I had dreams of holding a ninemilla to raise Killa Ask him why as my eyes fill up Each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas Its jungle when the niggas ensue The rats lurking vultures circling the serpents Cats lying through they teeth my nigga didnt deserve it I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel to make karma come faster than she normally will Its ill to see my faith try and leave me Its so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy Im tryna reach cloud nine thats what my niggas bout But it never rain in California less them pistols out Until then my feet planted on the ground Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding And if I get no answer just know I tried I should have never looked into his sons eyes Ray Charles voice     This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard Your minds slipping wondering is there really a God Knowing you shouldnt think that way and tryna freeze your brain But whenever its pain that feeling forever remains We cant believe what we cant see and reality seems stronger than prayer cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care at the tender age of twelve and you feel that no one cares Searching for answers thats human nature you aint in the wrong Just know when you feeling that way his spirits in the room I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost and wonder why I aint never caught that feeling before Maybe they know him better or I dont know no better But what I do know is that hes real and he lives forever So the next time you feel like your worlds about to end I hope you studied because hes testing your faith again  Id rather not live like there isnt a God than die and find out there really is think about it

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kendricklamar/goodkid.html::   Mass hallucination baby Ill education baby Want to reconnect with your relations This is your station baby   Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals Of a prisoner on his way Trapped inside your desire To fire bullets that stray Track a tire just tell you Im tired and ran away I should ask a choir what do you require To sing a song that acquire me to have faith As the record spin I should pray For the record I recognize that Im easily prey I got ate alive yesterday I got animosity building Its probably big as a building Me jumping off of the roof Is just me playing it safe But what am I supposed to do When the topic is red or blue And you understand that I aint But know Im accustomed to Just a couple that look for trouble And live in the street with rank No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face From a function that tooken place They was wondering if I bang Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks I dont mind because one day you respect The good kid mAAd city     All I see is strobe lights Blinding me in my hindsight Finding me by myself Promise me you can help In all honesty I got time to be copacetic And finally made decision to hold me against my will It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still I can never pick out the difference or cop on the bill Every time you clock in the morning I feel you just want to kill All my innocence while ignoring my purpose To persevere as a better person I know you heard this and probably in fear But what am I supposed to do With the blinking of red and blue Flash from the top of your roof And your dog has to say proof And you ask lift up your shirt Cause you wonder if a tattoo Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through Gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile I heard them chatter Hes probably young but I know that hes down Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest He dont mind he know we never respect The good kid mAAd city     All I see in this room Xanies and these shrooms Grownup candy for pain Can we live in the same society Its entirely stressful upon my brain You hired me as a victim I quietly hope for change When violence is the rhythm Inspired me to obtain The silence in this room With  Xanies and shrooms Some grownup candy I lost it I feel its nothing to lose The streets sure to release the worst side of my best Dont mind cause now you ever in debt To good kid mAAd city

on your brain It was me OBoogy Yaya YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans It got ugly waving your hand out the window Check yo self Uh warriors and Conans Hope euphoria can slow dance with society The driver seat the first one to get killed Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out At the same burger stand where censored hang out Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it But ever since that day I was looking at him different That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine Pack to stand on every porch is fine We adapt to crime pack a van with four guns at a time With the sliding door fuck is up Fuck you shooting for if you aint walking up You fucking punk picking up the fucking pump Picking off you suckers suck a dick or die or sucker punch A wall of bullets coming from AKs ARs aye yall Duck Thats what momma said when we was eating that free lunch Aw man God damn all hell broke loose You killed my cousin back in  Fuck yo truce Now crawl yo head in that noose You wind up dead on the news Aint no peace treaty just pieces BGs up to preapprove bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys When you hop on that trolley Make sure your colors correct Make sure youre corporate or theyll be calling your mother collect They say the governor collect all of our taxes except When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess MAAd city   Man down Where you from nigga Fuck who you know where you from my nigga Where your grandma stay huh my nigga This mAAd city I run my nigga   If Pirus and Crips all got along Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song Seem like the

street It aint nothing but a Compton thang Chyea How we do   Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad Sleeping in the living room in my mommas pad Reality struck I seen the white car crash Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him Security guard for a month and ended up leaving In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up Cocaine laced in marijuana And they wonder why I rarely smoke now Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding You know the reasons but still wont ever know my life Kendrick AKA Comptons human sacrifice   Cocaine weed Niggas been mixing shit since the s loc Sherm sticks butt nakeds Dip Make a nigga flip Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit One times crooked and shit Block a nigga in Alondra Rosecrans Bullis its Compton Im still in the hood Loc yeah thats cool The hood took me under so I follow the rules But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me A couple drivebys in the hood lately Couple of IVs with the fucking spraycan Shots in the crowd then everybody ran Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave Shots hit the enemy harsh turn brave Mount up regulators in the whip Down the boulevard with the pistol grip Trip we in the hood still So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand And a bird and  grands where motherfuckers stand   If I told you I killed a nigga at  would you believe me Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street With a basketball and some Now  Laters to eat If Im mashing all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat Would you say my intelligence now is great relief And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage Kill them all if they gossip the Children of the Corn They realizing the option of living a lie drive they body with toxins Constantly drinking and drive hit the powder then watch this flame That

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kendricklamar/singaboutmeimdyingofthirst.html::     When the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   I woke up this morning and figured Id call you In case Im not here tomorrow Im hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind Im behind on whats really important My mind is really distorted I find nothing but trouble in my life Im fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction Or a reaction of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright And a fight he tried to put up but the type Of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands My plans rather vindictive Everybodys a victim in my eyes When I ride its a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back whispering Get em I got em and I aint give a fuck That same mentality I told my brother not to duck In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if Ill ever discover A passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngn In pajamas and Duntaduns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs Dumb niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child Im proud and well devoted This piru shit been in me forever So forever Im a push it wherever whenever And I love you cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop I hope   Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it section the message resemble Brendas Got a Baby Whats crazy was I was hearin about it But doubted your ignorance how could you ever Just put her on blast and shit Judging her past and shit Well its completely my future A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit And Im a need that  dollars even if I gotta Fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot Gonzales Park Im followed by a married man a father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with Es He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes I run away and never do miss em See my hormones just run away and if I can get em back To where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader You need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her Thats how I was taught Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed And Im exhausted But fuck that Sorry for your loss shit My sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain If you cant fit the pumps I walk in Ill wait Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate and Im on the grind for this cake Im a get or die trying Im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying You lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help with my story You can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga Dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit   When the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me   Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself Am I really scared of passing away If its today I hope I hear a Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline Rake in the cent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance With the other side may come soon And if Im doomed may the wound Help me mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots And Im sure not why Im infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about Cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe cause Im dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the scheme of wondering when Im a rest And youre right your brother was a brother to me And your sisters situation was the one that put me In a direction to speak of something thats realer than the TV screen By any means wasnt trying to offend or come between Her personal life I was like it need to be told Cursing the life of  generations after her soul Exactly would have happened if I hadnt continued rappin Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four Fives I count lives all on these songs Look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong Fighting for your rights even when youre wrong And hope that at least one of you sing about me when Im gone Now am I worth it Did I put enough work in   Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  I said when the lights shut off And its my turn to settle down My main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me      Tired of running Tired of hunting My own kind But retiring nothing Tires are steady screeching the driver is rubbing Hands on the wheel who said we wasnt Dying of thirst Dying of thirst Dying of thirst  Dope on the corner Look at the coroner Daughter is dead Mother is mourning her Strayed bullets AK bullets Resuscitation was waiting patiently But they couldnt bring her back Who got the footage channel Cameras looking its hard to channel your energy When you know youre crooked Banana clip split his banana pudding Im like Tre thats Cuba Gooding I know Im good at Dying of thirst Dying of thirst Dying of thirst  How many sins Im running out How many sins I lost count Dreams of ballin like Spalding But only shotty bounce The reaper calling Im cottonmouth Money is power yours is ours Lay with a snitch die with a coward Hope we get rich hope we can tower Over the city with vanity with the music louder The same song A black flower Ill show you how to Dye your thirst Dye your thirst Dye your thirst  What are we doing Who are we fooling Hell is hot fire is proven To burn for eternity return of the student That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it Tired of running choirs is humming Tell us to visit we lying about coming Now back to business loading the guns in Back of the Buick your hood is feuding And the beef is bubbling Its no discussion hereditary All of my cousins Dying of thirst Dying of thirst Dying of thirst  Too many sins Im running out Somebody send Me a well for the drought See all I know is taking notes On taking this life for granted Granted if he provoke My best days I stress days Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know My best days I stress days Say Fuck the world  my sex slave Money pussy and greed whats my next crave Whatever it is know its my next grave Tired of running tired of running Im tired of tumbling tired of running Im tired of tumbling Backwards my mama say See a pastor give me a promise What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished The truth will set you free so to me be completely honest You dying of thirst You dying of thirst So hop in that water and pray that it works  SkitOutro

make room for mistakes and depression And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question  When shit hit the fan is you still a fan When shit hit the fan one two one two When shit hit the fan

room for mistakes and depression And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question  When shit hit the fan is you still a fan When shit hit the fan is you still a fan Want you look to your left and right ask you friends When shit hit the fan is you still a fan  Do you believe in me Are you deceiving me Could I let you down easily is your heart where it need to be Is your smile on permanent Is your vow on lifetime Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line If Im tried in a court of law if the industry cut me off If the government want me dead plant cocaine in my car Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K Lamar Or question my character and degrade me on every blog Want you to love me like Nelson want you to hug me like Nelson I freed you from being a slave in your mind youre very welcome You tell me my song is more than a song its surely a blessing But a prophet aint a prophet til they ask you this question  When shit hit the fan is you still a fan When shit hit the fan is you still a fan Want you look to your left and right make sure you ask you friends When shit hit the fan is you still a fan  The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me  Do you believe in me How much you believe in her You think she gon stick around if them  years occur You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt You think yall on common ground if you promise to be the first Can you be immortalised without your life being expired Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time Like who got your best interest Like how much are you dependent How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending How tough is your skin when they turn you in do you show forgiveness What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing What kind of bridge did they burn revenge or your mind when its mentioned You wanna love like Nelson you wanna be like Nelson You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom You wanna be remembered that delivered the message That considered the blessing of everyone this your lesson for everyone say  When shit hit the fan is you still a fan When shit hit the fan is you still a fan Want you look to your left and right make sure you ask you friends When shit hit the fan is you still a fan  The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me  I been wrote off before I got abandonment issues I hold grudges like bad judges dont let me resent you Thats not Nelsonlike want you to love me like Nelson I went to Robbens Island analysing thats where his cell is So I could find clarity like how much you cherish me Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be See I got to question it all family friends fans cats dogs Trees plants grass how the wind blow Murphys Law generation X will I ever be your ex Floss off a baby step mobbed by the mouth a bit Pause put me under stress Crawled under rocks ducking yall its respect But then tomorrow put my back against the wall How many leaders you said you needed then left  em for dead Is it Moses is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red Is it Martin Luther JFK shooter you assassin Is it Jackie is it Jesse oh I know its Michael Jackson oh  When

hope my flows they propel it Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression And if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga   I remember you was conflicted Misusing your influence Sometimes I did the same Abusing my power full of resentment Resentment that turned into a deep depression Found myself screaming in the hotel room I didnt wanna self destruct The evils of Lucy was all around me So I went running for answers Until I came home But that didnt stop survivors guilt Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned Or maybe how A my foundation was But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city I was entering a new one A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned The word was respect Just because you wore a different gang colour than mines Doesnt mean I cant respect you as a black man Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets If I respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us But I dont know Im no mortal man maybe Im just another nigga  Shit and thats all I wrote I was gonna call another nigga but it aint really a poem I just felt like its something you probably could relate to Other than that now that I finally got a chance to holla at you I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground What you mean  bout that what the ground represent   The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil Thats how I see it my word is bond I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people Cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what Im saying wealthy appetising The poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what Im saying its gonna be like  there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich   Aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities   I see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word I took nothin I took the opportunities I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what Im saying I made myself a millionaire I made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what Im saying I made millions for the record companies I made millions for these movie companies now I make millions for us   And through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity   By my faith in God by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true You know what Im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what Im saying I was noticing I was punching the right buttons and it was happening So its no problem you know I mean its a problem but Im not finna let them know Im finna go straight through   Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall   I like to think that at every opportunity Ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance And not only me but it goes down my family tree You know what Im saying its in my veins to fight back   Aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war Im fighting a war I cant win and I wanna lay it all down   In this country a black man only have like  years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back Cause once you turn  its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country And you dont wanna fight no more And if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth year old muthafuckas   Thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today   Shit I think that niggas is tireda grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be bloodshed for real I dont think America can know that I think American think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing Its gonna be murder you know what Im saying its gonna be like Nat Turner  up in this muthafucka You know what Im saying its gonna happen   Thats crazy man In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is Sometimes I be like get behind a mic and I dont know what type of energy Imma push out or where it comes from Trip me out sometimes   Because the spirits we aint really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us   Damn  I wanted to read one last thing to you Its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world It says  The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts Hes trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots such as going home and bringing back new
