  IntroChorus  If you can see if you can solve the mystery The answer revolves around your history So carefully I drop this degree Scientifically and realistically Who is God    In eternal blackness in the midst of the darkest night Proteins and minerals exist within specks of light Solids liquids and gases and sparks of light within infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights No beginning or ending the seven dimensions Enough space for more than a million words and inventions To travel through time within enough room to be the womb of the most highs great mind which he will soon make shine With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter Energies explode he below to keep releasin Atoms by the millions til the numbers increasin Til it was burnin he kept returnin itself to the source The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws All caused by his mental intercourse who is God    He began to explain his craft the master in the attic He dealt with measurements his language was mathematics His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system The complete number nine which means born or existed He gave birth to all planets inorganic and organic So you wouldnt take it for granted They rotated they own distance around the sun And fully submit to the existance of one And each one was promised everlasting perfection If each one keeps spinnin in the same direction To the East and each speak the motion of peace and harmony and each show devotion to teach The universe is to come the whole world must go according Know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round    From unconciousness to conciousness By knowledging his wisdom his response is this A understanding which is the best part He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start He pursued show and prove every move in order Back to the source he let off his resources in the water Climb his climax where the climate is at high degrees See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas And the plan is to lay in the clays to form land And expand usin the same clays to born man In his own image our origin begins in the East Culture rise to breed with the powers of peace Deal in equality natures policy is to be God Build or destroy positively born life like Allah And each one was given everlasting perfection If each one keep living in the same direction And life was life and love was love We went according by the laws of the world above They showed us physically we could reach infinity But mentally through the century we lost our identity Life start and ending we got trife and started sinning Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin And what was once easy became confused and hard Which brings us back to the mystic question who is God Sixtysix trillion years since his face was shown When the seventh angel appears the mystery will be known Check Revelations and Genesis St Luke and John It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Quran Wisdom Strength and Beauty one of the meanings of God GOD you and me Gomars O Dubar Knowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star Man Woman and Child and so is Allah    Bear witness to Allah gave birth to all For Allah was all and therefore life itself And the universe gave birth to man The universe was man and man was the universe And the universe was always existed And existance was life And life is Allah And Allah had no beginning because he is what always was Rakim Allah peace Now who is God
