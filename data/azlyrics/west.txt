niggaz on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push Miracle Whips   last call for alcohol for my niggaz   So this AR over at Rocafella named Hiphop picked the Truth beat for Beanie And I was in the session with him I had my demo with me You know like I always do I play the songs hes like Who that spittin Im like Its me Hes like Oh well okay Uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth just askin me to send him beats And Im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with And um he was friends with my mentor No ID And No ID told him look man you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer Ill sign you as a producer and a rapper Im like oh shit I was messin with uh DDot also People were like this started talking about the Ghost production But thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know After they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work But shit just went poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off layaway get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me so I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic  at that time and really I just like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on This Cant be Life And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of this whole sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hiphop Cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said oh you a real soulful dude  And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio you know how he do it one take And he said check this out tell me what you think of this right here tell me what you think of this And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion So he asked me what you think of it so what you thinkin And I was like man that shit tite you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homeys that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a UHaul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out So I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to Come on lets just go Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up Kanye baby were here I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh Heart of the City And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I could see hes in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I did nothing like already at that time But then Jay walked in I remember he had a GuccI bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said yo play that one beat for him And I played Heart of the City And really I made Heart of the City I really wanted to give that beat to DMX No I think Jay gon like this one right here And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that GuccI bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like yo whats up Im Kanye Yo you that kid Kanye You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics Jay got classics G You know I aint talkin shit Im like oh shit And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggaz on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hiphop was there I think Tata John Minnelli a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said yo Jay I could rap And I spit this rap that said uh Im killin yall niggaz on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the West the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said man that was tite That that was cool That was hot That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint H to the Izzo my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these ARs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats Gimme a beat that sound like JayZ You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these postBlueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like yo but I rap too Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some ARs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say naw Like Dave LottI fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man Man you niggaz is stupid if yall dont sign Kanye for real Im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up Yall niggaz is stupid Lets just say I didnt get my deal The nigga that was behind me I mean he wasnt even a nigga you know The person who

its actually kinda hot Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like yo man we we on a brick we on a brick you dont wanna catch a brick You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all oh word Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer rapper and told H that told the heads of the Capitol and right the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said yo Capitol pulled on the deal Yo Capitol pulled out on the deal And you know I told them that Rocafella was
