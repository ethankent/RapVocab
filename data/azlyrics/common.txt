   She rested her head upon my chest Sensed liberation in between breaths Wonder if sex is what she found it in Peace found it laying down with men Wasnt there to judge her many ways I loved her It was more than bodies we shared with each other We laid under the cover of friends A place where many lovers began I began to feel her body shake in my hand Body language its so hard trying to understand Usually after sex its a good feel Took by silence emotion stood still I could feel her tears spill from her grille Hurt from before that began to build She told me hold me a story she assembled it Tellin it trying not to remember it It was a story of innocence taken Thought she could redeem through love makin When she was eight she was raped by her father And tried to escape through multiple sex partners Felt pitiful she had only learned To love through the physical inside it burned My heart turned I thought of what this man did She forgave him she grew to understand it Her soul was tired and never really rested Only with men through aggression Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason By speaking it she found freedom Between me and you   Sometimes I wish a careless whisper Serenade her without speaking a word Because of you Im stronger Im afraid no longer I feel so alive in me you have liberated me   She laid I watched her breathe Happy to be here not afraid to leave I couldnt conceive her not being here Death in her face her not having fear Less than a year she was diagnosed with it Memories of that year so close and vivid Happiness would only visit once in a while To watch an adult becoming a child Somehow I knew shed make it The life of one so given early would God take it Hurt she placed in hope and prayer Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair I stare with my eyes closed Wonder when the body leave does the mind go Watchin Jordan became less important Seeing this disease eat away my aunts organs According to doctors theres no cure We went through doubt and cases of insure Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs Knew a part of her I could heal with words But the Creator was sending for her What seemed like the end was the beginning for her Like that she didnt want us to remember her No more medication did she want us to give to her It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath Only to be freed through death Between me and you     He spoke with his eyes tearfilled A lump in his throat his fear built My whole life it was in steel This aint the way that men feel A feeling he said he wish he could kill A feeling not even time could heal This is how real lifes supposed to be For it to happen to someone close to me So far wed come for him to tell me As he did insecurity held me I felt like he failed me To the spirit yelled help me Id known him for like what seemed forever About going pro we dreamed together Never knew it would turn out like this For so long he tried to fight this Now there was no way for him to ignore it His parents found out and hated him for it How could I judge him Had to accept him if I truly loved him No longer he said had he hated himself Through sexuality he liberated himself Between me and you    Liberation Peace

making noise but they tried to mute it They put him through it For him to make the system look stupid They rather look you in the face and shoot it And leave your spot looted Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught When you scream at it and do it With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid Dont understand the point that you at Or how the hell you came to it Flashback to images of

Natural lifer a soul he had to fight Learn it himself sleep days stay up half the night Amongst dead man walking he got afterlife exercising Developing his knack to write Never leaving his cell in this world he trapped himself What he loved on the outside world detached himself You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life Its amazing to a man what a book could do And how certain books seem to look for you This is the story of a

  Yo we all got different things we got to deal with We always are trying to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at ourselves recognizing a lot of the stuff that happensbut if we look within ourselves we could prevent a lot of this nonsense Its about relating back to the essence where it all stems from Ima do my thing over this drum like a native tongue    Do what you will if you feel that your steeze is real complicated with the skills over reel to reel brown skin is what i feel my mind and bodys appeal is to the nofrill mills who hear the beats to chill constantly Im hearing Black Americans just sneering Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either Hitting us up with great emotional chat about the fact that the black is constantly held back Like  tracks back in a relay race and the white teams ahead so lets keep up the pace And I be needing something To feed my logical taste At the end of the race is there a paradise place Yo we cant get involved in what the next man is doing Material gain we put too much in persuing Yo duke I need this dough so we can step to this party But we can all mardi grati Minus that shit in our body What that got to do with that Cause kid thats the essence your physical presence embodies every lesson You cant run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted Cant even life the knife to cut the mustard What we need to do first Now listen to this verse Lets concentrate on our spiritual plate Recognize your existence in this vast blue space From a tiny cloud of blood To the human beings with taste sight touch smell and sound Lets deem it profound And prioritize this cause it was Allahs wish Allah Im God No I ddont believe that Thats a mystery If God is so good why does shit be happening to me Theres divinity within because we come from the divine A froce thats not seen But you feel it every time When the wind blows and the world turns and the rain drops and the baby cries and the bird flies and the ground quake and the stars gleam So many things are eident of its existence What we need to do is link it with persistence Once we recognize that we can move ahead Native Tongue Common Sense yo hes HipHop bred   From the spiritual world my former life has developed First person I lost close to me was Stella Some of my mellows Lost their mothers and their brothers For them I feel empathy But I aint pouring out no liquor for no niggas I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck Knowing two weeks ago he slappedbox with death I hear of niggas dying in the windin the news But when its somebody you know it hits you and emotions get bruised I aint been in your shoes I wont judge you for knocking Because the spirit of the ghetto says You Gotta They snatch you again from rock flippin Give back into the neighborhood you better start kickin Stickin stores On the strip Im tired of Arabs giving me my change back Devil bomb my yesterday My tomorrow he never gave back I lay back looking at the ceiling Wonndering what can I do So my homie wont have to be dealing Not cause you serving and Im rapping Im better Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life That we have to put together better ourselves cause families we gotta raise No matter how long the money Shorter become the days Men become like women and no difference in the season If you got popped five times You breathing for a reason Lets put the five tenure plan into progression Before we count our paper Count our blessings
