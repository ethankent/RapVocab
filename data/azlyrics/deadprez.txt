   Im not a hunter but i am told that uh in places like in the arctic where indiginous people sometimes might might hunt a wolf theyll take a double edged blade and theyll put blood on the blade and theyll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice so that only the blade is protruding and that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat  and it will come and lick the blade trying to eat  and what happens is when the wolf licks the blade of course he cuts his tongue and he bleeds  and he thinks hes really having a good thing and he drinks and he licks and he licks and of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself thats what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine you have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something  they gonna make a living with  they is getting something they can buy a car like the white people have cars why cant i have a car? they getting something they can get a piece of gold white people have gold why cant i have gold? they getting something to get a house white people have a house why cant i have a house? and they actually think that theres something thats bringing resources to them but theyre killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade  and theyre slowly dying without knowing it thats whats happening to the community you with me on that? thats exactly precisely what happens to the community and instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice  for the wolf  that what happens is the wolf gets the blame gets the blame for trying to live thats what happens in our community you dont blame the person the victim  you blame the oppressor Imperialism white power is the enemy was the enemy when it first came to Africa and snatched up the first African brothers here against our will isss the enemy today  and thats the thing that we have to understand

    Help me  You want me to help you? Man is evil capable of nothing but destruction     Once upon a time There was a very serious situation growing There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals And this is the story of their times     Old man Sammy had a farm Walked the land with the wife  Most of the time shit was calm His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor  from the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable This is how we kept food on this table maxing You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing Acting like Mr Magnificent But the animals were thinking something different The sentiment was tension in the barnyard Throughout the years they had been through mad drama  with the farmer word is bond And they all came to one conclusion They argued there was no way theyd ever be free If it was up to humans Therefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals They planned a full attack Under the leadership of Hannibal The fattest pig in the pack The next morning on the farm Everything was calm Just before dawn But before long The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric Now check it This is when that shit got hectic Directed by Hannibal the animals attacked Old Sam was in a state of shock And fell up on his back And dropped his rifle Reaching in vain Each and every creature from the field at his throat Screaming "Kill feel the pain"     This is the animal in man This is the animal in you This is the animal in man Coming true      After they ran the farmer off the farm The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn Hannibal spoke for several hours But when talks about his plans for power Thats when the conversation turned sour He issued an offical ordinance to set If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate Thats when the horses went buckwild One of them shouted out  "You fraudulent pigs we know your fucking style" Hannibals face was flushed and pale All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal He felt the same way Sam felt They took his tongue out of his mouth And cut his body up for sale for real You better listen while you can Its a very thin line between animal and man When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand What would have done? Shook his hand? This is the animal in man         Remember

  My big brother Revolutionary love You know your lil brother love you dawg You know your sister love you dawg You know your mama love you dawg We riding right here with you dawg Be strong man Keep pushing forward Look here  Youre my brother and I love you and I wrote this for ya If I could change anything its what that dope did to ya Coming up I looked up to being just like you Same crease in my khakis tried to dress like you You getting swole lifting weights stocking caps with waves Im trying to see the world how you see it wearing you shades You and pops never really got along who was right or wrong 15 years old kicked out all alone in this cold world And I can only imagine what you was going through Cause I was so young when it happened Mama cried like a baby that day She never blamed you it was painful Cause she knew the streets was waiting to claim you Over time we could see the hardness in your face Wanted to help but couldnt find the words to say I guess I went into denial hoping for the very best Stopped believing in they God cause what God would allow this? Not in my wildest nightmares nothing compares To see my brother be a crack fiend for all these years Tried to send you inspiration when you was locked in the pen But soon as you came home you right back on that shit again And mama say she dont feel safe with you home She got to hide money and lock her room door when she gone We still love you but until you find strength in yourself And the will power to open up and accept our help What can we do? I cant let you terrorize mom dukes We feeling like we just gone have to turn you loose They say in war theres no victory without causalities But when it hits your family thats when you really see  Like a window to my soul you can see the pain in my life Got to make a change in my life its a struggle every day And its not impossible to make a change in my life gotta keep pushing forward I can make a change in my life I know aint no other way  I know its hard coming home to the same old shit Aint nothing changed cause the game dont quit The pain inside is still throbbing The same conditions that first created the drug problems still exist And its a bitch got to go to the job or starve Without a gun every day employees get robbed And on days off we blow off them crumbs like nothing Getting high cause a nigga gotta get into something But we get trapped in a cycle of pain and addiction And lose the motivation to change the condition I blame it on the system but the problem is ours Its not a question of religion its a question of power How did black life my life end up so hard? Why do so much injustice go unresolved? Why the ones we call governments be the main causes Behind why all the dope is coming through the borders Television reporters got the facts distorted Making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner Its a war even though they dont call it a war Its chemical war unleashed on the black and the poor And who benefit? the police lawyers and judges The private owned prison industry with federal budgets All them products in the commissary Tell me who profits its obvious and its going too good for them to stop it  In my mind my body and my soul I need a change in my life We need a change in our lives you know And its not impossible to make a change in our lives We can take the pain from our lives fa sho  We dont own no boats We dont own no planes to bring no dope We dont make no cellophane bags to bag it up We just caught up in the game Dont you know  Dont you know its bigger than this shit I know you know I know whats in your heart dawg I love you til the end of time And again and again Imma be your brother your comrade and your friend Til we win and even then

     What you know about the running the stretching The cars the weapons The path the journey The jewels the learning The fear the focus The aches the pains The contact sparrin the breaks the sprains The trial and error the ranks and belts The spiritual growth the science of breath The tests the techniques The forms the stances The flow the rhythm the internal answers The herbs the healing the quiet meditation The truths reveal through daily dedication The love for the art the sweat on your shirt The mind the body and the spirit that work The feelings of failure the hope to succeed The battles of questions like "Should I smoke weed?"   The water the thirst The cleansing the blessings The flash of insights the teachings the lessons The grappling and locking trapping and boxing The training and slacking The starting and stopping And stayin committed when your homies aint with it The hours or practice after the class is finished The cause of your ignorance flaws in your discipline Broken laws of nutrition and pork and dishin The vitamins and supplements Salads and ointments  The kingships pull joints in doctor appointments The dues the pads the wraps the gloves The mouthpiece you left home the taste of your own blood The hunger the blocks The punches the squats The crunches the example you set for the youngsters The will the skills the kill or the hill The separation between whats fake and whats real The laws of physics The class "comradery" The vows of humility the bow the courtesy     Self defense doesnt mean you run and attack someone But you do have the right to defend yourself by any means necessary If you in that position to defend yourself Ha
