   Im not a hunter but i am told that uh in places like in the arctic where indiginous people sometimes might might hunt a wolf theyll take a double edged blade and theyll put blood on the blade and theyll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice so that only the blade is protruding and that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat and it will come and lick the blade trying to eat and what happens is when the wolf licks the blade of course he cuts his tongue and he bleeds and he thinks hes really having a good thing and he drinks and he licks and he licks and of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself thats what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine you have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something they gonna make a living with they is getting something they can buy a car like the white people have cars why cant i have a car they getting something they can get a piece of gold white people have gold why cant i have gold they getting something to get a house white people have a house why cant i have a house and they actually think that theres something thats bringing resources to them but theyre killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade and theyre slowly dying without knowing it thats whats happening to the community you with me on that thats exactly precisely what happens to the community and instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice for the wolf that what happens is the wolf gets the blame gets the blame for trying to live thats what happens in our community you dont blame the person the victim you blame the oppressor Imperialism white power is the enemy was the enemy when it first came to Africa and snatched up the first African brothers here against our will isss the enemy today and thats the thing that we have to understand

    Help me  You want me to help you Man is evil capable of nothing but destruction   Once upon a time There was a very serious situation growing There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals And this is the story of their times   Old man Sammy had a farm Walked the land with the wife Most of the time shit was calm His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor from the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable This is how we kept food on this table maxing You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing Acting like Mr Magnificent But the animals were thinking something different The sentiment was tension in the barnyard Throughout the years they had been through mad drama with the farmer word is bond And they all came to one conclusion They argued there was no way theyd ever be free If it was up to humans Therefore the only course left was revolution which was understandable And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals They planned a full attack Under the leadership of Hannibal The fattest pig in the pack The next morning on the farm Everything was calm Just before dawn But before long The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric Now check it This is when that shit got hectic Directed by Hannibal the animals attacked Old Sam was in a state of shock And fell up on his back And dropped his rifle Reaching in vain Each and every creature from the field at his throat Screaming Kill feel the pain   This is the animal in man This is the animal in you This is the animal in man Coming true   After they ran the farmer off the farm The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn Hannibal spoke for several hours But when talks about his plans for power Thats when the conversation turned sour He issued an offical ordinance to set If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate Thats when the horses went buckwild One of them shouted out You fraudulent pigs we know your fucking style Hannibals face was flushed and pale All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal He felt the same way Sam felt They took his tongue out of his mouth And cut his body up for sale for real You better listen while you can Its a very thin line between animal and man When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand What would have done Shook his hand This is the animal in man     Remember

   Let me now turn to our program for the future The economy right now is extremely supportive of the president and his policies FBI scientists have found chemical traces consistent with a bomb or a missle on a piece of wreckage Police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators They called me a mother bleeped outing soandsoand a white facistlike they said youre getting some of your own medicine   Telling lies to our vision Telling lies to our children Telling lies to our babies Only truth can take us away   You cant fool all the people all of the time But if you fool the right ones then the rest will fall behind Tell me whos got control of your mind your world view Is it the news or the movie youre taking your girl to uh Know what im sayin cause Uncle Sam got a plan If you examine what they tellin us then you will understand What they plantin in the seeds of the next generation Feeding our children miseducation No one knows if theres UFOs or any life on mars Or what they do when they up in the stars Because i dont believe a word of what the president said He filling our head with lies got us hypnotised When he be speaking in cold words about crime and poverty Drugs welfare prisons guns and robbery It really means us theres no excuse for the slander But whats good for the goose is still good for the gander See   I dont believe Bob Marley died from cancer years ago i woulda been a panther They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer The views that you see in the news is propaganda   Telling lies to our vision Telling lies to our children Telling lies to our babies Only truth can take us away   I dont want no computer chip in my arm I dont wanna die by a nuclear bomb I say we all rush the pentagon pull out guns And grab the intercom my first words will be I believe Man made God outta ignorance and fear If God made man then why the hell would he put us here I thought hes supposed to be the all loving The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven We dont fall for the regular shit they try to feed us All this halfass leadership flippin position They turn politcian and shut the hell up and follow tradition For your TV screen is telling lies to your vision Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots Its a plot but busta can you tell me whos greedier Big corporations the pigs or the media Sign of the times terrorism on the rise Commercial airplanes falling out the sky like flies Make me wonder what secrets went down with Bob Brown Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found Its not coincidence its been too many studied incidents It coulda been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics But it probably was the FBI deep at the call Cuz if they make us all panic then they can start martial law   I dont believe Bob Marley died from cancer years ago i woulda been a panther They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer The views that you see in the news is propaganda  I dont believe Bob Marley died from cancer years ago i woulda been a panther You killed Huey cause you knew he had the answer The views that you see in the news is muthafuckin propaganda   Police is telling lies fooling millions What are they teaching our kids in these school buildings Televised enterprised in all the killing Controlling our lives this aint living No this aint living   FBI CIA ATF KKK IRS TNT CBS NBC  FBI CIA ATF KKK IRS TNT CBS NBC   Telling lies to our vision Telling lies to our children Telling lies to our babies Only truth can take us away   uh we view each other uh with uh a great love and a great understanding and that we try to expand this to the general uh black population and also people oppressed people all over the world and i think that uh we differ from uhmm uh some other groups simply because we understand the system better than uh most uh groups understand the system and uh with this realisation uh we attempt to form a strong political base based in the community with the only strength that we have and thats the strength of uh a potentially destructive force if we dont get freedom
