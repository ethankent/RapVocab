   Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die And even though we both came from the same places The money and the fame made us all change places How could it be Through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask For currency but you could run to me when you need And Ill never leave honestly Someone to believe in as you can see Its a small thing to a true what could I do Real homies help you get through And come to knew hed do the same thing if he could Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good And half the times we be actin up call the cops Bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block It never stops when my mama ask me will I change I tell her Yeah but its clear Ill always be the same until the end of time   So take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of time   Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids So you know I dont hang around the house much This all night money making got me outta touch Shit aint flashed a smile in a long while An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs My attitude got me walking solo Ride out alone in my lolo Watching the whole world move in slowmo For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean Smoking Ports think my thoughts then its back to coastin Who can I trust in this cold world My phony homie had a baby by my old girl But I aint trippin Im a player I aint sweatin him I sexed his sister had her mumble like a Mexican His next of kin no remorse it was meant to happen Besides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin Until the end of time   So take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of time   Now whos to say if I was right or wrong To live my life as an outlaw all along Remain strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators And in the end drinking Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow eliminatin easily Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breathe While beggin me to keep the peace haha When I conceive closer to achieve In times of danger dont freeze time to be a G Follow my lead Ill supply everything you need An ounce of game and the training to make a g Remember me as an outcast Outlaw Another album out thats what Im about more Getting raw til the day I see my casket buried as a G While the whole world remembers me until the end of time   So take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again until the end of time So I can fly away until the end of time Until the end of time until the end of time

   Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning Mind full of demons I dont wanna hear them anymore Got me heartbrokenfine so many babies screaming Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being So they start smoking weed well never get our day Until we learn to pray keep our families in shape Cause they all broke and why do ghetto birds die Before we learn to fly some bodies elses child caught in guns Smoking weed can all make a change So Im told but I havent seen the change unfold I keep hoping please if you prefer to breathe Communities in need of people that will lead Keep your eyes open I can only say Ill try Until the day I die I promise to be wise With my heart open greed brings only misery A way to tragedy so I stay sucker free Only a few chosen rise rise My ghetto queen rise rise Dont be afraid to try try Too many of us died to the door to open wide My brother be wise stay focused on the prize Though everybody dies We can   Only learn to take our anger and our hate Control our mental state settle down and just set it straight Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes For we said it regret it later and let it escalate Cause by then its too just late theres so much we can take Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate To the point that he just breaks snaps and thats all it takes Youd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes But we aint Its plain to go against with every artists comes the image he portrays And a picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this angst Never once did you hear me say Im a gangster and I aint hear no complaints But I know that I will always continue to grow As long as I lead and never follow no one elses shadow There will never be another me And that I can guarantee Thats why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day The game will never be the same No matter how much fame or success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do There will never be another you You can search but youll never find You can try to rewind time But in your hearts and your minds We will never die We are forever alive And we continue growing   One day at a time  Dont be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype Rappers are regular people minus money and light Searching for fortune and fame and super stardom All the jewelry all the cars whose crew is the hardest Now the hiphop police the villains is watching And kids think beef is the only option Outlaws born filthy guilty as charged My memories of Khaddafi but Makaveli lives on You think the industry is fun And no pity with guns And when your money is up Thats when your enemies come So if he died and came back Would he try to save rap We needing a change the drama remains  I spent my whole life fighting myself That I cant win so Im inviting some help and every now and then I take rights from left Im still just like a kid looking for stripes on my belt And that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope god Take a like to myself No matter how much I try stay alive Im gunna die mad still standing there in love with my pride  Heard frivolous beats we past that Im trying to keep some income coming in And collect on my ass cap The rappers in the game aint changed And I finally realized that we not in the same game The hating will never end so I guess Ill deal wit it Them  with cop killers just some steel wit it The streets is military you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling One way at a time keep the faith in your mind and we continue growin   One day at a time Damn

  Uhh Hit them with a little ghetto gospel   Those who wish to follow me my ghetto gospel I welcome with my hands And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns   If I could recollect before my hood days Id sit and reminisce thinking of bliss of the good days I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to em They tested it was stress that they under And nowadays things changed Everyones ashamed to the youth cause the truth looks strange And for me its reversed we left them a world thats cursed and it hurts cause any day theyll push the button and all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing Dont them let me get teary the world looks dreary but when you wipe your eyes see it clearly theres no need for you to fear me if you take your time to hear me maybe you can learn to cheer me it aint about black or white cause were human I hope we see the light before its ruined my ghetto gospel     Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad Living out a bag but shes glad for the little things she has And over there theres a lady crack got her crazy Guess shes given birth to a baby I dont trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan We jump into another form of slavery Even now I get discouraged Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage I refuse to be a role model I set goals take control drink out my own bottles I make mistakes but learn from everyone And when its said and done I bet this Brother be a better one If I upset you dont stress Never forget that God hasnt finished with me yet I feel his hand on my brain When I write rhymes I go blind and let the lord do his thang But am I less holy cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies Before we find world peace We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets My ghetto gospel     Lord can you hear me speak To pay the price of being hell bound
