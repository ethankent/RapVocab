   Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough To feel what Im about to say in this song When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself And you do it and get the feeling its wrong That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping And they try to make you out as a lie Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason Its a lose lose why even try When your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected And they never really know how to feel Phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics And the motives to try and make them a mill You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and Niggas wanna say that you aint around I mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town   You gonna try to try harder cuz Try harder cuz Try TryTryTry   And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher than most of these rappers running the game Concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash Theres time I would have done it the same I mean I got me a range Also got me a guilty conscience That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers Because Im really tend to need what I spent In a house that I promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time I wasted late out at the club Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner Im working hard on the winner so this album is a labor of love You say as long as Im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats That she can rest without a toss and a turn Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV Thats exactly why I often get burned But Im gonna try to   You gonna try to try harder cuz Try harder cuz Try TryTryTry

  Why do I feel so alone Like everybody passing through the studio is in character As if he acting out a movie role Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know And I dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go So they stick around kicking out feedback And I entertain it is if I need that I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that My privacy about the only thing I need back But Its hard thinkin in polite flows When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes And you still make it even when they say your flight close Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows Life was so full now the shit just been lypod Always said Ill say it all on the right track But in this game you only lose when you fight back Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics I cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this I make hits and like a bitch thats married I aint miss hours from greatness Im that close Dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt Transitioning from fitting in to standing out Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South Watch Hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out So I park about  houses down She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown But I dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around So she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness Got niggaz reacting without a sinus Cause what Im working with is timeless And promoters trying to get me out to they club And say I have fun but I cant imagine how Cause I just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that Im fucking right now And shit can get weird unless they all down And so I stay clear we from a small town And everybody talks and everybody listen And somehow the truth just always comes up missing Ive always been something that these labels cant buy Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly And he just be like silly motherfucker I know That was your bad how can you pass up on em He just take them records and he gas up on em Wayne would probably put a million cash up on em Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em Oh they did Po at least they tried to And thats what happen when you spitting what inside you But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video And they think they can market you however they decide to Nah before they told me to do me And dont listen to anybody that knew me Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me Boy and to my city Im the Two Three Drug dealers live vicariously through me I quit school and its not because Im lazy Im just not the social type and campus life is crazy Understand I could get money with my eyes closed Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know Cause they need it much more than I ever will I got new shit Im getting better still Little niggaz put my name in they verses Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal Future said cause its Ye shit you better kill And I think this got that making of a legend feel Problem with these other niggaz they aint never real Yea its all I can say

   Money just changed everything I wonder how life without it would go From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow Lookin  down from the top and its crowded below My fifteen minutes started an hour ago Truth over fame you know I respect the blatant shit When I hear them talking I just dont know what to make of it Hate is so familiar to me I m slowly embracing it Doesn t come natural bear with me it could take a bit Yeah and my dreams are who I m racing with And you can see I m pacing it so that I m always chasing it Wayne put me right here thats who I get the paper with I hope that my success never alters our relationship Yeah this life is something I would die for Octobers own but its looking like July I just wish they d let you try it first This time I m really going off fireworks   Today it begins I missed them before but wont miss them again I keep having the same dream And I think that I just realized what it means   All I see is fireworks All I see is fireworks Every night its fireworks Every night its fireworks All I see is fireworks All I see is fireworks Taking off like fireworks Taking off like fireworks   I m just such a gentleman You should give it up for me Look at how I m placing all my napkins and my cutlery I could tell it wasn t love I just thought you fuck with me Who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me Damn I kept my wits about me luckily What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me But I was curious and I ll never forget it baby What an experience You couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious Their was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it That felt good all and all I learned a lesson from it though You never see it coming you just get to see it go Yeah I shouldve looked up in the sky at first Now I can see it in her eyes Fireworks       Everything the same but it feels different My dad called me up knowing that I still listen And he s still got his foot out guilt trippin It s been years though I just learn to deal with it For real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport Got my mother in a place with some better decor She searched the entire city I let her explore And now she s sayin  she s more lonely than ever before How many of our parents  marriages lasted I was only  I bet I barely reacted I m flying back home for the heritage classic Searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic Let s stay together  til we re ghosts I want to witness love I ve never seen it close Yeah but I guess I gotta find it first that s why I m really going off Fireworks
