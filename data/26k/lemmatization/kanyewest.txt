sound you know i got to come in and track the beat andat the time i wa still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hiphop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there a time in every man life where he got ta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the songcause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said check this out tell me what you think of this right here tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i wa thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i aint
