a chain in a range that is not paid for my cousin from the south said he just bought him a house that lives around his neck like a white collar so why fastforward then i rewind a time machine can help me double back to slavery times picking cotton from a field that a white man own the blacker you are farther you from the white mans home negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity before your vanity they parted our families they put us in hundreddegree shade and outside we bathed the more we were afraid the more they made rules and trapped our minds in the cage our freedom was so fake couldnt see it with the eyes of tracee ross uh and school was exempt see wecouldnt have smarts and a smirk could get you hurt wound diversed from a scar fourhundred years of nothing fourhundred years of suffering fourhundred years of tears and tribulation miseducation see what we facing is now coming back to the roots remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot call us and figured that wed never lived in pursuit of happiness we captured these feelings in things that we do thought its abstinence in slavery but we made it come to a modern perspective my shoe selection got

kobes my cousin from the south slavery start in the south and i bet ya he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors so blame it on the fourhundred years we never saw the reason why the next fourhundred we got ta floss slaves uh i say the fourhundred years we never had nothing barely had clothes on our back its the reason why when we get alittle bit of change we overexaggerate on our living expenses so if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house youre a vanity slave if youre a female and you got four five six rings on your finger four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing youre a vanity slave if you got an monte carlo with twentyfos on it and on the back of the window it says get on my level hoe youre a vanity slave we all vanity slaves and

bottles of water a day two packs of marlboro reds and uh what keeps me alive um music i have to listen to music all day long i say that keeps me going im a pretty dark person ive thought about ending it a million times and i have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing thank you sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go right now freestyle or write down whatever and still i come upclever i just need to free my thoughts and lord knows that i know better but i aint perfect i aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses you should either hear me now or go deaf or end up dead die trying and know death might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect i mean that from the bottom of my heart you see my art is all i have and victory tastes sweet even when the enemy can throw salt still knock em out thepark like a tow car let bygones be bygones but where im from we buy guns and more guns to give to the young im living the life of a trapped inside the system all you envision is trap my uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight he told me rap about life not rap thats why im shaking my head when you rap dissing my stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching i start evaluating then my final intuition is that you wishing a come up would just come up we used to beefing overturf beefing over a verse dying a double entendre and this is compton lions in the land of the triumph wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance put burners in the hands of the black man one hood with twenty fofos like a cloned kobe bryant you probably heard i wan na be heard and wonder who i am you probably even listen to faith and think i know zion but really im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth because it seem like its always clashing with science i got a big fear of flying my futureso bright id probably go blind before i blink twice i aint lying i swear to god half of yall just dont know kendrick the school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance you walking down the block he got shot you wouldnt know i witnessed you just mind your bidness you just

pops wasnt anxious to seeyou when you hated him so much you probably had your burner tucked in graduation said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him facing twentyfive to life with a murder charge your enemies was the prey and now you pray to god i pray these bars get farther than compton and if my record never break i still wont break my promise i promise to keep it honest secret society all we ask is trust and all we lack is communication like service sucks the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come and im like thekendrick lamar od in less than a month alright got ta keep it pushing cant let the government tell me how my future looking im on rosecrans central trying to duck the central bookings if the pigs get behind me then you know im bucking never will i

to me that place i used to call home is just a bed to me and we dont even sleep neighbors can hear her weep meanwhile im in these streets with everybody im trying to get it and she know they got me i watch her feelings watch me as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness look each other in the face and barely blink i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink so if my letters dont

aint got it why you always buy me something when you going shopping why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me want my company rather than going club hopping why you treating my

rolling their eyes at me why text messages popping up saying hi daddy why you treat me like im nothing why you always at a function i be wanting to go out but you dont never ask me why you slip and say her name when we having why you always assuming that i still love my ex everytime we get into it im the one thats feeling stupid you dont need me you gon leave me thats your favorite threat why you never know how it feel to be lonely why i feel im the last option after your homies why you always got ta know that i will never let you go even though you get violent and put your hands on me

listen and she only gives advice she says when i give her a cue she says she loves me like when i wake up in the morning shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me she says she needs me she says she loves me or like when im stepping out of the shower shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off she says she says she loves me so instead of
