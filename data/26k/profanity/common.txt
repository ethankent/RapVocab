the funk makes me wan na shout wan na shout wan na shout after beinyou know just trying to survive in the world bout to have a little boy or baby girl who knows anyway just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you you start thinkin about stufftryin to make the right moves so bust it out this is what i was thinkin check it yo the education of the lonchickalonnie lynn began began with time bein my bloodline is one with the divine in time brotha you will discover the light some say that god is black and the devils white well the devil is wrong and god iswhats right i fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear the rain aint gone but i can still see clear as a child given religion with no answer to why just told believe in jesus cuz for me he did die curiosity killed the catechism understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that i played to and became a slave to master self a rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health my mind had dealt with the books of zen tao the lessons koran and the bible to me they all vital and got truthwithin em got ta read them boys you just cant skim em different branches of belief but one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em and use religion as an emblem when it should be a natural way of life who am i or they to say to whom you pray aint right thats who got you doin right and got you this far whether you say in jesus name or hum do allah long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you you let that show towards others in the thingsyou do cuz when the trumpets blowin elders surround the throne only gon get home only gon get home only gon get it baby chorus ceelo ive lived and ive learned i have taken and ive earned i have laughed ive cried i have failed and i have tried sunshine pouring rain found joy through all my pain i just wan na be happy with being me ceelo let me voice my concern so many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence subconciouslyseeking to find an impressionable mind to convince ive finally come to the realization why black people in the worse place cuz its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place so i try to find the clue in you but evidently white folks know more black history than we do whyre we bein lied to i aint know our history was purposely hidden damn somethin in me wan na know who i am so i began my search my journey started in church it gave my heartache relief when i started tounderstand belief hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets taught me survival from this evil im just gon na have to deal with and i felt like a fool when i tried to learn it in school it almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal takin elder advice read the bible the koran searched scrolls from the hebrew israelites hold on this aint right jesus wasnt white some leads were granted with insight and its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand hestill created with the imperfection of man so with followin i disagree by no means have i forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but i do know the devil aint no white man the devils a spiritual mind thats color blind theres evil white folk and evil you gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity but one side you gon na have to choose any chance to speak i refuse to misuse so how can you call yourself god when you let a worldly possession become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cantfollow your lesson if a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own if you god then save your own dont mentally enslave your own well ive lived and ive learned ive taken and ive earned i have laughed i have cried i failed and i have tried sunshine pourin rain i found joy through my pain just wan na be happybein me bein me this the city of chicago the stateof confusion this style im using is free or prolly it would be if my mind was peep im behind cause i didnt handle my function while in high school although i was cool the hood i live in aint that proper cause a cop a stop ya and have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty im not filthy nor am i rich aint that a like life is not your wife is see that your butter halve do your math and peep that two halves make a whole and all i have tohold is my self pride so these here streets i strive like a black pantha asking can the situation get much worst all i do is try to appeal to the masses as the phrase keep it real passes the teeth of too many phoney individuals snakes that smooth like criminals they create chemicals that the earth hate doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate id settle for lesser knowing im worth wait or worth my weight in precious gems so im steadily steadly steadly trying to lose my religion like r e m created in his own imageso am i we him and in the middle of this crises i wonder where christ is well he damn sure not in k town or in the wild hundreds where they broadcast gd till the world blowup and stone run it hunted by police for display in state vile cages come out to receive minimum wages plus with a desiese thats contagious it is outrages the amounts of black and brown they lock up but the most high encourages me to put the glock up and stock up on do for self knowledge a brother couldnt afford to goto collage so i went to the school of hard knock on the hard blocks of the chi even i think about moving out to river oaks as my liver soaks in mad hennesy cause i have a bad tendency to do a lot of drinking but now i do
