look in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players rappers they tend to be smilin because they swimmin in women most of em sick of favors they come in secret flavors thats why i envy omar because so far and thats some higher learning tryingta excel with the brake on ill have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin and im a liar turnin jaded with no faith in any female thats askin what i was earnin i met this recent lady she knew a piece of sadey by spinners i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby cuz she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy now im out of bothand ive been thinkin of aleshia lately im all alone i got a feelin its on cuz nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces circling workplaces and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is they get to first bases then they get to retreating cuz if she cheatin he wan na know what the first trace is now you like macgyver cuz you sneakin around and she dont know that you there when you standinright beside her i cant relate to that i had to take it back a couple a years when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it with and they lewis and a couple things that they true in and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do cuz its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife and i used to be eager to buy em the world maybe im confused about what i desire from girlseither way im all alone got a feelin its on cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone check and nowadays some girls are the type of person that will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin since i aint made them a purchase yet but theres logic behind it emotions double and they try to cover up like a mansion with the projects behind it i tend to freak with this i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendinand all she gave was a decent kiss thinkin she been spoiled but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days and come up with tin foil we could dissect it see you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing gave her nothing her reputations in jeopardy cuz it aint take her of that shopping to get her next to me collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me for thinkin thatexists i got a feeling im wrong nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone look if you a girl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so much more to my dudes at the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of thespeech coz im from the city where people be gettin lazy litterin in the streets and the club district is poppin like literally every week and promotersll push flyers money exchange hands liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans hustlers give you events bouncers give you pass directors give em a shot so girlsll give up the ass and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock daffy and bugs its all laughing and hugs til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was right back on thebus its ashame cuz now at his rental she throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch you can see thats shes colder cuz he doesnt hold her fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder know that he tried ta told her that he couldnt mold her if this the type of chick you wan na be when you older i say if you a girl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth somuch more to my dudes at the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of the speech coz now up north theres five artists deservin a listen and im one of em the other four you know who you are but if you got ta think through chances are that it aint you i singlehandedly carry out what you cant do and see i take a couple of breathers and then things come together on the spot like a couplethats eager if you wan na pack a duffel and leave her go ahead i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers but uh the in the out whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill and every verse the man seem to kill you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill japan and brazil the audience acreaming and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill advances to deals financing appeals the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh if you agirl with the aspirations of being in the background witcha asses shakin hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin i ask you to have some patience youre worth so much more to my dudes in the bar with a freak and steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in and look forward to being a star on the weekend ya are part of the speech coz uh yea get in my slick rick mode na mean im a tell ya a story real quick look she got a saying theres no alice without the tin mancrib was mil plus i just bought a couch for ten grand even if the house was ten grand and there was no pool would i still be witout my swim fan the ceiling could be higher she making requests dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her and purses are light now she use

its your only option girl theres things to do other than jail time look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers or pasha and sasha esther baxter melyssa ford or katy or anyone after i just give my opinion for laughter or maybe to think on so next time you out at the club and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on now he

she a video girl yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its decemberim driving and shes like wheres my hi i swear that i never called you cause i really get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowing and if you planning family vacations you better know when but somemothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wan na get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet sinceim driving i ask her how to get the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda takin itback for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter didon the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop onthe plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for carrabanna and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime voice drake i miss you most of aaaallll myy daarling gim me a second to gather my toughts strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spriing such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strollingin the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her bythe end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handin them crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkini find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the and when they talk about theypast and lovers and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive strolling in the park and watching winter

catch the metaphors and the rest of this its not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist which means if goes bad i say i expected this and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate instead of understanding its a tune of hate the citys mine like oklahomas a sooner state and were gon na have to cross paths whether soon or late so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut you aint morris chestnut you lighter and less cut and lets behonest by now you should be your own scholar you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler you got rappers being repetitive actors you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boi southern smoke yeah ren mof haha its drake man its drake manyeah ayo ren this that gritty here man ima half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean ho southern smoke very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing thesamples that they using cant get through the clearing ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it my fathers early careering forced my parents to split up my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus and he got back into doing what he was doing before us because money is an issue your son he gon miss you and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too now you looking for exes you aint never expect this youend up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt and mommy ima support her i keep it all in order see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border but i got stress on my shoulders trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers itsstress my im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what i been through i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you picture when i was in school me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i wasinto rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight but when someone called me a id punch them i couldnt help it now im grown i can say what it is its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids and your daddy want it very right i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white because black is black honey even if hes very light and so i never been for dinner at they placesalways brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces i live it so the case is whether drake is way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist i got stress on my shoulders trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers its stress my im just trying to live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo im just tryingto live my life cuz make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best like girls with double ds i got ta lot on my chest theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test instead of staring at quizzes now its models with breasts and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician homie i probably could of been on tv consistentan artist like pablo or maybe peteys assistant and my mindset is come and get me im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson get the handgun if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond that have you laying out on the curb they some hitmen last

little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this that gritty boy im just trying to live my life cuz got me winded over here man make a little money find a bunny to make mywife cuz bo bo bo bo uh sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what im about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling its wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason its a lose losewhy even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and wan na say that you aint around i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town you gon na try to try harder cuz try hardercuz try trytrytry and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher than most of these rappers running the game concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash theres time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because im really tend to need what i spent in ahouse that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time i wasted late out at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winner so this album is a labor of love you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv thats exactly why i often get burned but im gon na try to yougon na try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry uh what up yall soundtrack whats popping baby yall aint know i go by the name of lupe fiasco representing that first and fifteen jyea uh and this one right here

to pull my phantom out so i park about houses down she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around so she wonders wheremy mind is accounts in the minus and yet i role around the city like ya highness got reacting without a sinus cause what im working with is timeless and promoters trying to get me out to they club and say i have fun but i cant imagine how cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im right now and can get weird unless they all down and so i stay clear we from a small town and everybody talks and everybody listen and somehow the truth just always comesup missing ive always been something that these labels cant buy especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul and
