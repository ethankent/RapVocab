lyrical mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips last call for alcohol for my so this ar over at rocafella named hiphop picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him i had my demo with me you know like i always do i play the songs hes like who that spittin im like its me hes like oh well okay uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth just askin me to send him beats and im thinking hestrying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with and um he was friends with my mentor no id and no id told him look man you wan na mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap yo you wan na sign him tell him you like how he rap i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wan na manage me as a rapper and a producer ill sign you as a producer anda rapper im like oh i was messin with uh ddot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how i got in the game if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gon na do some more work but just went poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buyget a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this hal melville sample i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic at that time and really i just like picked the drums off xxplosive andput it like with it sped up sampled and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of this whole sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hiphop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin causei been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he got ta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said check this out tell me whatyou think of this right here tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it so what you thinkin and i was like man that tite you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just inchicago im trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been one of my homeys that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went downand tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my up in a uhaul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk me and my mother drove to come on lets just go newark new jersey i hadnt even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up kanye baby were here i unpacked all my you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and thefirst beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i could see hes in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i did nothing like already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him andi played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx no i think jay gon like this one right here and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooooooooooh two days later im in baseline and i seen dame dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye yo you that kid kanye you that kidthat gave all them beats to jay yo this got classics jay got classics g you know i aint talkin im like oh and all this time im starstruck man im still thinking bout you know im picturing these on the show the streets is watching im lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i got ta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the cant be lifebeat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hiphop was there i think tata john minnelli a bunch of people i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh im killin yall on that lyrical mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the west the rap was like real wack and so thatsall the response he said man that was tite that that was cool that was hot that was it you know i aint get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at this time youknow i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these ars and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats gim me a beat that sound like jayz you know they riders whatever so ill play them these postblueprint beats or whatever and then ill play my ill be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks andthey didnt sign me you know what happened it was some ars that with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say naw like dave lotti with me my mel brought me to a bunch of
