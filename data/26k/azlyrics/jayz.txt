rhyme where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer Where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set To achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets So I felt some more something and you nothing check I from the other side with other guys dont walk to much And girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us if we talked too much So they ran up Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust I dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us Im from where the beef is inevitable Summertimes unforgetable Boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new Your world was everything So everything you said youd do You did it Couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it I from where niggas pull your car and argue all day about Whos the best MCs Biggie JayZ and Nas Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are At each others throats for the love of foreign cars Where cats catch cases hoping the judge R and Rs But most times find themselves locked up behind bars Im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars Im from Marcy son just thought Id remind yall Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son Aint nothing nice Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own Im from the place where the chruch is the flakiest And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist Where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow Cause the day after well be saying damn I was just with him yesterday Im a block away from hell not enough shots away from straight shells An ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale Your laughing you know the place well Where the Liqour Stores and the base well And Government fuck Government niggas polotic themselves Where we call the cops the ATeam cause they hop out of vans and spray things And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eightteen Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize If the shit is lies god strike me And I got a question are you forgiving guys who live just like me Well never know One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow Let em know Mistakes aint exactly what takes place in the ghetto Promise fulfilled but still I feel my job aint done Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice Im from where they crossover and clap boards Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords listen Im up the block round the corner and down the street From where the Pimps Prostitutes and the Drug Lords meet We make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep And fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off weed And no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat Whether your fourfeet or Minute size it always starts out with Three dice and shoot the five Niggas thought they douce was live
