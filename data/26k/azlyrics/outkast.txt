Suppose We rolls through Headland and Delowe where me and my niggas surpassed the flow And got down for ours like hind catchers My mind catches flashbacks to the black past while my close niggas laugh at The Southern slang figure ways and mojo chicken wangs I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang So go head and diss it while real hophippers listen Started by Afrikan Bambaata so you

believe that you die but I can feel it in the wind The beginning or the end But people keep your head to the sky Shake that load off shake that load off Folk in your face youre a superstar Niggas hang around cause of who you are You get a lot of love cause of what you got Say they happy for you but they really not Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz Swoll up in the spot now you losing friends All you wanna do is give the world your heart but the label tried to make you compromise your art You make a million dollars make a million mo First class broad treat you like a nigga po You wanna say Wait but youre scared to ask as your world starts spinning and its moving fast Try to stay sane its the price of fame Spending your life trying to numb the pain You shake that load off and sing a song Liberate the minds then you go on home I must admit they planted a lot of things in the brains and the veins of my strain Makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine From them whores from the flame From a post in the game Makes it hard to maintain focus Theyre from the glock rounds and lockdowns and berries The seeds that sow get devoured by the same locusts Cause its a hard row to hoe if your ass dont move and the rain dont fall And the ground just dry But the roots are strong so some survive So youre surprised now Im bustin cries You got more juice than Zeus Slanging lightning trying to frighten Plains dwellers of the Serengeti But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded Melanin silicon and collagen injected Dissecting my pride fool I dont wanna get it started We be the lionhearted without a fantasy Its like that red sprite you cant imagine it unless you lookin at the canvas of life and not through the peephole of mortality Single minded mentality Gettin over on loopholes Gettin
