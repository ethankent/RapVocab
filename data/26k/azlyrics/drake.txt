them about I been through on this know what I mean HO Southern Smoke Very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics Or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing The samples that they using cant get through the clearing Ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it My fathers early careering forced my parents to split up My mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up With just being a florist the choir sang his chorus And he got back into doing what he was doing before us Because money is an issue your son he gon miss you And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too Now you looking for exes you aint never expect this You end up doing time and me I end up with a stepsis Nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went You know

rap music what I was into Rest of the kids were sheltered I never liked to fight But when someone called me a nigger Id punch them I couldnt help it Now Im grown I can say what it is Its parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids And your daddy want it very right I make you happy plus Im Jewish he dont approve I think he want you to marry white He want Sinatra at the wedding not Barry White Because black is black honey even if hes very light And so I never been for dinner at they places Always brutally honest and so I pin it to they faces I live it so the case is whether Drake is Way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist I got stress on my shoulders Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers ITS STRESS MY NIGGA Im just trying to live my life cuz Make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO BO BO BO Im just trying to live my life cuz Make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO BO BO BO Am I hot as the rest should I strive for my spot as the best Like girls with Double Ds I gotta lot on my chest Theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test Instead of staring at quizzes now its models with breasts And yes when Im dismissed after a tedious listen I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician Homie I probably could of been on TV consistent An artist like Pablo or maybe Peteys assistant And my mindset is come and get me Im all alone at home with my mom and

over here man Make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO BO BO BO Uh Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough To feel what Im about to say in this song When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself And you do it and get the feeling its wrong That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping And they try to make you out as a lie Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason Its a lose lose why even try When your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected And they never really know how to feel Phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics And the motives to try and make them a mill You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and Niggas wanna say that you aint around I mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town You gonna try to try harder cuz Try harder cuz Try TryTryTry And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher than most of these rappers running the game Concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash Theres time I would have done it the same I mean I got me a range Also got me a guilty conscience That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers Because Im really tend to need what I spent In a house that I promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time I wasted late out at the club Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner Im working hard on the winner so this album is a labor of love You say as long as Im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats That she can rest without a toss and a turn Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV Thats exactly why I often get burned But Im gonna try to You gonna try to try harder cuz Try harder cuz Try TryTryTry Uh what up yall Soundtrack whats popping baby Yall aint know I go by the

oclock in the morning at the studio Why do I feel so alone Like everybody passing through the studio is in character As if he acting out a movie role Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know And I dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go So they stick around kicking out feedback And I entertain it is if I need that I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that My privacy about the only thing I need back But Its hard thinkin in polite flows When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes And you still make it even when they say your flight close Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows Life was so full now the shit just been lypod Always said Ill say it all on the right track But in this game you only lose when you fight back Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics I cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this I make hits and like a bitch thats married I aint miss hours from greatness Im that close Dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt Transitioning from fitting in to standing out Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South Watch Hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out So I park about houses down She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown But I dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around So she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness Got niggaz reacting without a sinus Cause what Im working with is timeless And promoters trying to get me out to they club And say I have fun but I cant imagine how Cause I just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that Im fucking right now And shit can get weird unless they all down And so I stay clear we from a small town And everybody talks and everybody listen And somehow the truth just always comes up missing Ive always been something that these labels cant buy Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly And he just be like silly motherfucker I know That was your bad how can you pass up on em He just take them records and he gas up on em Wayne would probably put a million cash up on em Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em Oh they did Po at least they tried to And thats what happen when you spitting what inside you But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video And they think they can market you however they decide to Nah before they told me to do me And dont listen to anybody that knew me Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me Boy and to my city Im the Two Three Drug dealers live vicariously through me I quit school and its not because Im lazy Im just not the social type and campus life is crazy Understand I could get money with my eyes closed Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know Cause they need it much more than I ever will I got new shit Im getting better still Little niggaz put my name in they verses Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal Future said cause its Ye shit you better kill And I think this got that making of a legend feel Problem with these other niggaz they aint never real Yea its all I can say Hands down Im too proud for love But with eyes shut Its you Im thinking of But how we move from A to B it cant be up to me cause you dont know Who I was before you Basically to see a change in me Id be losing so I just ignore you yeah Oh oho But your on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind Oh oho But maybe in time in time in time Ill tell you A little bit a little bit A little bit in love with you I guess that Im a little bit a little bit a little bit in love with you Oh oho I know you told me break their hearts But its you I wanna take apart And I will never ever be the first to say it But still I they know I ah ah ah I would do it Push a button Pull a trigger Climb a mountain Jump off a cliff cause you know baby I love you love you A little bit You

the questions You could teach me many things Im just scared to learn a lesson The pressures on Both hearts beat like a metronome Both nsync like a Justin song Feels so right but its just so wrong I wonder where my whereabouts Where niggas that I know tryna talk my girl out And her friends say I aint the one to go for She just get jealous cause you always get approached more Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back Tell her get a man that aint cheating on her ass With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that that And as for you I think I know youre the one The closest Ive come Im probably A little bit A little bit A little bit in love with you I guess that Im a little bit A little bit A little bit A little bit in love with you Oh oho Lololololove with me Oh oho oh oho You know a lot of girls bethinking my songs about them but This is not to get confused this ones for you Baby youre my everything youre all I ever wanted We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it You be up on everything other hoes aint ever on it I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up When I get right I promise that we gone live it up She make me beg for it till she give it up And I say the same thing every single time I say You the fuckin best You the best I ever had Best I ever had I say you the fuckin Know you gotta roommate Call me when theres no one there Put the key
