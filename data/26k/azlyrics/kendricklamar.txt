the realest shit thats ever been told to man I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service Embarrassed so I started questioning God what is my purpose He say to live the way he did thats all he want from me Spread the word and witness he rose on the first Sunday I said alright enthused that my Lord gave a listen I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian and this from a person that never believed in religion But shit my life is so fucked up man I cant help but give in Im giving testimonies to strangers I never met Hopped on the pulpit and told em how I was truly blessed Felt like Im free from all my sins when the service was over Walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered and lost my faith again What am I gonna do Gotta have faith Life is too much understood Where is your faith Oh faaaaaaaith All you need is the size of a mustard seed Single black parent from Compton raising children of four Thats four innocent bastards cause papa they dont know Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters Cant find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister Her baby daddy aint bout shit that nigga aint bout shit Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit She pray to God every night hoping that hell mature and maybe one day his kids something that hell live for Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help because its hard tryna pay the bills when youre by yourself She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice that said the Devil is a lie make a better choice And so its back to McDonalds and every month dealing with them crazy ass people at the county building Looked to the heavens and asked em to make a better way Then got a letter in the mail lost her section Then lost her faith again Kendrick I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga This about how faith works yeah murk it I had dreams of holding a ninemilla to raise Killa Ask him why as my eyes fill up Each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas Its jungle when the niggas ensue The rats lurking vultures circling the serpents Cats lying through they teeth my nigga didnt deserve it I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel to make karma come faster than she normally will Its ill to see my faith try and leave me Its so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy Im tryna reach cloud nine thats what my niggas bout But it never rain in California less them pistols out Until then my feet planted on the ground Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding And if I get no answer just know I tried I should have never looked into his sons eyes Ray Charles voice This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard Your minds slipping wondering is there really a God Knowing you shouldnt think that way and tryna freeze your brain But whenever its pain that feeling forever remains We cant believe what we cant see and reality seems stronger than prayer cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care at the tender age of twelve and you feel that no one cares Searching for answers thats human nature you aint in the wrong Just know when you feeling that way his spirits in the room I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost and wonder why I aint never caught that feeling before Maybe they know him better or I dont know no better But what I do know is that hes real and he lives forever So the next time you feel like your worlds about to end I hope you studied because hes testing your faith again Id rather not live like there isnt a God than die and find out there really is think about it Boarding completed Id like to welcome you aboard flight number FB Our scheduled flying

wild inside when my world collide with your world where your girl and your kids reside We kill the facades we feel free to fly Were birds that reserve in the charismatic sky I care about my pride too much if my clothes is new if my ride is plush if my hair is cut if my diamonds is crushed I look in the mirror Im trendy enough Wrong Insecurity roams the black community Homes where kids must have jewelry The high school female need earrings and details so she can be cool to be amongst popularity The various name brands that reach the price scan thats not about the right price but more like the right scam to rule us all confuse us all Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw Now lets draw the picture of a rapper with a chain in a Range that is not paid for My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house that lives around his neck like a white collar So why fast forward Then I rewind A time machine can help me double back to slavery times Picking cotton from a field that a white man own The blacker you are farther you from the white mans home Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity Before your vanity they parted our families They put us in hundreddegree shade and outside we bathed The more we were afraid the more they made rules and trapped our minds in the cage our freedom was so fake Couldnt see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross uh And school was exempt see we couldnt have smarts and a smirk could get you hurt wound diversed from a scar Fourhundred years of nothing fourhundred years of suffering Fourhundred years of tears and tribulation miseducation See what we facing is now coming back to the roots Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot Call us niggers and figured that wed never lived in pursuit of happiness we captured these feelings in things that we do Thought its abstinence in slavery but we made it come to a modern perspective my shoe selection gotta be Louie Her handbag gotta be Gucci its fake then she foobie She still bad though and her fake Gucci aint that bad though We filling up the gas for Rollies Upgrade to twentysixes out there riding Kobes My cousin from the South slavery start in the South and I bet ya he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors So blame it on the fourhundred years we never saw The reason why the next fourhundred we gotta floss Slaves Uh I say the fourhundred years we never had nothing Barely had clothes on our back Its the reason why when we get a little bit of change we overexaggerate on our living expenses So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house Youre a vanity slave If youre a female and you got four five six rings on your finger four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing Youre a vanity slave If you got an Monte Carlo with twentyfos on it and on the back of the window it says get on my level hoe Youre a vanity slave We all vanity slaves and with that being said can somebody please tell me where the mall at Im not from around here Hey Ali where we at Idaho Yeah nigga you know the first of the month You know them checks come in Im tryna get something but what up A nigga so goddamn stressed out I feel

couch now Im thinking bout my daughter Times is getting harder another beat is slaughtered Just press record or seems like I need a mill to keep my shit in order instead of problem solving From my hat

Lamar what are you trying to say What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar I think that I finally reached the pinnacle of finding myself as an individual The world is so typical I just wanna be higher than that I used to want to be the messiah of rap Infatuated with becoming a relevant star Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars that I never had but wrote it in my raps to make you mad Vanity they say that it can damage me So do I really want it If I didnt I guess Im a cool cocaine connect That means Ill be fronting hmm Cooking in a laboratory hoping I can tell a story that the whole world can feel like the ones that came before me Knowing that Im misunderstood So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty and all I could say is will the radio care Yeah or should I say no Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old Well that was me then now Im an adult Twentytwo like the smallest of guns that you know most determined but with the smallest of funds to show but Im not worried My talent should take me places Ive never been The world should turn soon as my record spin I wanna be the highest on top of all the bullshit The negative you bring the stress the violence The capital punishment the loud police sirens Too focussed one word righteous And this is Kendrick Lamar and soon yall know cloud nine yall And that means I wanna be the highest Too focussed one word righteous Mm yeah That means I wanna be the highest Too focussed one word Too focussed too focussed one word Too focussed too focussed one word Too focussed too focussed one word Too focussed one word Too focussed too focussed one word I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible because it will reveal to you why it is true that whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve regardless of how many times you have failed in the past or how lofty your aims and hopes may be Go getter with no cheddar Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater My life is likely to see great endeavors But I cant win if I cant get it together What I gotta do in order to see success Having the worlds best to call me the best Pull up at the Grammy Awards as bestdressed with an address next to a beautiful actress A dollar and a dream I feel J Cole Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes that dont wanna fuck with a broke nigga with

address next to a beautiful actress Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting Better yet rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing Hear a hustle from a nigga thats constantly bragging Catch him at the light snatch him out his Jeep wagon Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose Cop five bricks of the yay head to the Bay Area or carry the birds to the gate Let the clips distribute the work all day Then come back home Every three weeks flip threetosix zones Homies on the block can say whatever they want I dont wanna be a dealer I wanna be a Trump Donald that is And when I do it I do it again then I go back When I do it Ill do it again then I go back Thug it out but for now Im willing to dug it out I gotta grind grind So welcome to the story of my life See Im tryna get right off the shit that I write Make a fortune buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife Pops engine in this old school run tight But as you listening to K DOT Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC She listening to Drake and all I can say Damn these niggas that much better than me Baby I dont think this is meant to be cause Im always losing selfesteem She paused the iPhone then said huh I repeated what I said then she replied shut up You know you the best boy you gotta keep doing it But dont forget when you do just keep you in it And never listen to what the industry say Dont be a typical artist be more like Jay Russell Barry Gordy Quincy Jones Bob Johnson Sean Combs LA Reid Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed yeah So I gotta see success I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps Rising to the top like a soda shook up Bout to pop and Ill pop on whoevers in my way Yeah I swear to God I dont wanna do it just live man I wanna live good Just wanna make my momma proud yknow I dont wanna be hard I dont want the most stripes I got lil brothers and sisters man Im the oldest nigga I just want it I just want it and Ima get it Ill tell you what I dont believe in can I do that Alright I dont believe in the in laws or the system by any means whatsoever I try not to obey them at any time Thats what I believe in not believing in So what keeps you alive Four big bottles of water a day two packs of Marlboro Reds and uh what keeps me alive Shit um Music I have to listen to music all day long I say that keeps me going Im a pretty dark person Ive thought about ending it a million times and I have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing Thank you Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go right now freestyle or write down whatever And still I come up clever I just need to free my thoughts and Lord knows that I know better but I aint perfect I aint seen too many churches or know them testament verses You should either hear me now or go deaf or end up dead die trying and know death Might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath Fuck a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect nigga I mean that from the bottom of my heart You see my art is all I have and victory tastes sweet even when the enemy can throw salt Still knock em out the park like a fucking tow car Let bygones be bygones but where Im from we buy guns and more guns to give to the young Im living the life of a nigga trapped nigga inside the system all you envision is trap niggas My uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight He told me rap about life not rap niggas Thats why Im shaking my head when you rap dissing My stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching I start evaluating then my final intuition is that you wishing a come up would just come up We used to beefing over turf fuck beefing over a verse Niggas dying motherfuck a double entendre And this is Compton lions in the land of the triumph Wrap Saran our defiance ban our alliance Put burners in the hands of the black man One hood with twenty fofos like a cloned Kobe Bryant You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am You probably even listen to Faith and think I know Zion But really Im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth because it seem like its always clashing with science I got a big fear of flying My future so bright Id probably go blind before I blink twice I aint lying I swear to God half of yall just dont know Kendrick The school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance You walking down the block he got shot you wouldnt know I witnessed You just mind your bidness You just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennises Its kinda scary aint it You cant act like no bitch that only got Tyler Perry famous Just let me explain this why you pick up that stainless Cause your pops wasnt anxious to see you when you hated him so much you probably had your burner tucked in graduation Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him facing twentyfive to life with a murder charge Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God I pray these bars get farther than Compton And if my record never break I still wont break my promise I promise to keep it honest Secret society all we ask is trust and all we lack is communication like service sucks The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come And Im like the Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month Alright Gotta keep it pushing Cant let the government tell me how my future looking Im on Rosecrans Central trying to duck the central bookings If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know Im bucking never will I surrender Ive been a warrior when I came out of my moms placenta In the gutter lane like Im Master Splinter How splendid I guess my project had did it Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different They said seven tracks I said fifteen Called it an EP they said Im tripping But little did they know Im tryna change the rules that weve been confined to so the corporate wont make decisions Uppity bitches handling bidness Killing our dreams stealing our vision Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home In LA everybody think they fucking on Hop on Twitter perpetrate we doing big shit Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone I swear to God most yall cats just dont know Kendrick You barely know yourself so I guess most of yall should be offended Aint doing this for my health Im just trying to purchase my momma them businesses Occupy my time with riches justify my time ambitions just to coincide just to go inside books we idolize while we living Look the mastermind took the masters mind just the perfect time just to mastermind Just to master grind with precision look the mastermind took the We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD Because of you we are Overly Dedicated Where are we going Why are we slowing down Where are you going We should be growing now Smoke to it nigga smoke to it nigga Thats what she said to me That place I used to call home is just a bed to me and we dont even sleep neighbors can hear her weep Meanwhile Im in these streets with everybody Im trying to get it and she know they got me I watch her feelings watch me As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness Look each other in the face and barely blink I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink So if my letters dont reach you I hope these lyrics in sync Thats what it said to me But that place I call ambition now dead to me Gone and forgotten Im off track like Dale Earnhardt My liver rotten alcoholic tripping Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions Club night guys and dolls Balling out but Im bout to drop the ball Im calling out for help my engineer called Told me come to the studio I wanna tell him nah Thats what he said to me But that place we call Heaven unfair to me Only a hundred and fortyfour can go Seven billion people on planet earth today Is there something that I dont know I know to follow him rather following people or follow vanity cause that means Im following evil Guess Im following evil I should follow cathedral Blessings I need but live like I dont need you So in conclusion We all seem to stumble planning our own demise Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size So to whats important in my life I apologize I promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified We all get distracted The question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards Would you not know how to act or take action Its just a part of life And if your visions impaired you probably lose it all tonight Im trying to visualize how to get it right But my visions so blurry Trying to slow it down stay close to the ground But were always in a hurry now And if I could make this world stand a little slower Then I would then we could grow a little closer I think were getting closer I think were getting closer I remember uh All my uncles Sir Smokers on the landra in front of our building They was my heroes This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead This shit is so dope you might wanna be my

conartist Why you couldnt Why you couldnt be mischievous or just a lil devious the moment that we first started Why you never ask for nothing just a lil time Why you let me use yours cause I dont got mines Why you always lift me up when Im completely giving up Or when niggas holler whats up you give a dry response Why you giving me your last knowing you aint got it Why you always buy me something when you going shopping Why you tell me that you love me Why you always thinking of me Want my company rather than going club hopping Why you treating my momma like she your momma too Why you making promises that youll forever do Whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you sometimes We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us Hurt people that love us love people that hurt us Sometimes I sometimes I feel we share nothing in common it aint fair But where do we seem to fall Where do we seem to fall Tender love and care once upon a time Once upon a time we was there And so she said why you gotta be so mean to me Why you dont know what you mean to me Why you always playing games Why I feel like you ashamed out in public curse me out and make a scenery Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy Why you treat me like Im nothing Why you always at a function I be wanting to go out but you dont never ask me Why you slip and say her name when we having sex Why you always assuming that I still love my ex Every time we get into it Im the one thats feeling stupid You dont need me you gon leave me thats your favorite threat Why you never know how it feel to be lonely Why I feel Im the last option after your homies Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go even though you get violent and put your hands on me Sometimes She says she loves me she says she loves me so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone But shes beautiful Like sometimes when I have things on my mind shes the perfect person to listen and she only gives advice she says when I give her a cue She says she loves me Like when I wake up in the morning shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me She says she needs me she says she loves me Or like when Im stepping out of the shower shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off She says she says she loves me So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake she says she says she loves me And I dont know about love I used to want to be like Michael Jordan Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune Uh every time Im in my city I be hacking

had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel I want to ride like Arabians Push an MercedesBenz Hello my name is Kendrick She said No youre handsome Whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancing Ciara had played in the background The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now cool Where you stay She said Down the street from Dominguez High Okay I know thats borderline Compton or Paramount Well is it Compton No she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and Strictly had one of her thighs around me Seventeen with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental My motive was rather sinful What you trying to get into She didnt tell just gave me her Nextel Dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well The summer had passed and now Im liking her Conversation we having probably enticing her Who could imagine maybe my actions would end up wifing her Love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us Its deep rooted the music of being young and dumb Its never muted in fact its much louder where Im from We know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict She live with her granny and her younger two brothers Her favorite cousin Demetrius has a reputable History of gang banging did make me skeptical But not enough to stop me from getting a nut I wanna come over whats up Thats what I told her soon as this episode Of Martin go off Im trying to get off I was in heat like a cactus my tactics of being thirsty Probably could hurt me but fuck it I got some heart Grab my mommas keys hopped in the car then oh boy So now Im down Rosecrans in a caravan Passing Alameda my gas meter in need of a pump I got enough to get me through the traffic jam At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man Im thinking bout that sex thinking bout her thighs or maybe kissing on her neck or maybe what positions next Sent her pictures of her titties blowing up my texts I looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette Enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse And Im a professional porn star when off the Goose I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom I hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem Im two blocks away feet and six steps from where she stay She waving me cross the street I pulled up a smile on my face And then I see Two niggas two black hoodies
