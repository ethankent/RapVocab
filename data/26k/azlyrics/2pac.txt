kill for our women Time to heal our women be real to our women And if we dont well have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man cant make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up I know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up Keep ya head up ooh child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up ooh child Thingsll get brighter Keep ya head up ooh child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up ooh child Thingsll get brighter Ayo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feeling like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough And though we had it rough we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how Id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen Im trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents Its hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems Im heading for the pen I try to find my friends but theyre blowing in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rainll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up You know its funny when it rains it pours They got money for wars but cant feed the poor Say there aint no hope for the youth And the truth is it aint no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby We aint meant to survive cause its a setup And even though youre fed up Huh you got to keep your head up Keep ya head up ooh child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up ooh child Thingsll get brighter Keep ya head up ooh child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up ooh child Thingsll get brighter And uh to all the ladies having

gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we
